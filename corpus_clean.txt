I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil
I don't oppose all wars My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, fought in Patton's army He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil
I don't oppose all wars
After September , after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again
I don't oppose all wars What I am opposed to is a dumb war What I am opposed to is a rash war What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne
What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression
That's what I'm opposed to A dumb war A rash war A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics
Now let me be clear: I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein He is a brutal man A ruthless man A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him
But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighborsand that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history
I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda
I am not opposed to all wars I'm opposed to dumb wars So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the president
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's finish the fight with Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, through effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security program that involves more than color-coded warnings
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure thatwe vigorously enforce a nonproliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of terrorist cells
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil through an energy policy that doesn't simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil
Those are the battles that we need to fight Those are the battles that we willingly join The battles against ignorance and intolerance Corruption and greed Poverty and despair
The consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable We may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom, and pay the wages of war But we ought not – we will not – travel down that hellish path blindly Nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice, who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood, to make such an awful sacrifice in vain
On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant
But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place: America, which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before While studying here, my father met my mother She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity
And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation They would give me an African name, Barack, or "blessed," believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential They are both passed away now Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride
I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my precious daughters I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, "We hold these truths to he self-evident, that all men are created equal That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"
That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody's son That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will he counted ? or at least, most of the time
This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations And fellow Americans ? Democrats, Republicans, Independents ? I say to you tonight: we have more work to do More to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $, a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on More to do for the young woman in East St Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college
Don't get me wrong The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white No, people don't expect government to solve all their problems But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all They know we can do better And they want that choice
In this election, we offer that choice Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer That man is John Kerry John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and sacrifice, because they've defined his life From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available His values and his record affirm what is best in us
John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he'll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option, but it should never he the first option
A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear-eyed, with an easy smile He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than  service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world
Now let me be clear We have real enemies in the world These enemies must be found They must be pursued and they must be defeated John Kerry knows this And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure John Kerry believes in America And he knows it's not enough for just some of us to prosper For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga
A belief that we are connected as one people If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother If there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties It's that fundamental belief ? I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper ? that makes this country work It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family "E pluribus unum" Out of many, one
Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America there's the United States of America There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats But I've got news for them, too We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America
In the end, that's what this election is about Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope John Edwards calls on us to hope I'm not talking about blind optimism here ? the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it No, I'm talking about something more substantial It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too The audacity of hope!
In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us America!
Tonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do ? if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come Thank you and God bless youJohn Lewis's th Birthday Gala
Compete Text Thank you It's an honor to be here tonight to celebrate one of the most courageous and compassionate Americans of our time Happy Birthday John
When I was first asked to speak here, I thought to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis
And then I thought, you know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress And there was a time not long before that when people might never have guessed that someday, African-Americans would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress
But we can, and I'm here, because people like John Lewis believed Because people like John Lewis feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs Because they were willing to spend sleepless nights in lonely jail cells, endure the searing pain of billy clubs cracked against their bones, and face down death simply so that all of us could share equally in the joys of life
How far we've come because of your courage, John
How far we've come from the days when the son of sharecroppers would huddle by the radio as the crackle of Dr King's dreams filled his heart with hope He was often forced to leave school to work in the fields and the public library was off-limits to his kind, and yet young John Lewis sought knowledge His parents were never the type to complain or try to stir up any trouble, and yet their son sought justice
And so he organized, even when so many tried to stop his efforts He spoke truths, even when they tried to silence his words And he marched, even when they tried to knock him down again and again and again
The road John chose for himself was not easy But the road to change never is
I think it's simple for us to look back forty years and think that it was all so clear then That while there may be room for moral ambiguity in the issues we debate today, civil rights was different That people generally knew what was right and what was wrong, who the good guys and the bad guys were But the moral certainties we now take for granted - that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our children should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together - were anything but certain when John Lewis was a boy
And so there was struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage And there was the culmination of it all one Sunday afternoon on a bridge in Alabama
I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day Not only John and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom
And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage? When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gaswhen they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation? Truly, this is the audacity of hope
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of themafter all that, they went back to march again
They marched again They crossed the bridge They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of  was signed into law
And so it was, in a story as old as our beginnings and as timeless as our hopes, that change came about because the good people of a great nation willed it so
Thank you, John, for going back Thank you for marching again
Thank you for reminding us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things That in the face of the fiercest resistance and the most crushing oppression, one voice can be willing to stand up and say that's wrong and this is right and here's why And say it again And say it louder And keep saying it until other voices join the chorus to sing the songs that set us free
Today, I'm sure you'll all agree that we have songs left to sing and bridges left to cross And if there's anything we can learn from this living saint sitting beside me, it is that change is never easy, but always possible That it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our worst fears; but from great discipline and organization, from a strong message of hope, and from the courage to turn against the tide so that the tide eventually may be turned
Today, we need that courage We need the courage to say that it's wrong that one out of every five children is born into poverty in the richest country on Earth And it's right to do whatever necessary to provide our children the care and the education they need to live up to their God-given potential
It's wrong to tell hardworking families who are earning less and paying more in taxes that we can't do anything to help them buy their own home or send their kids to college or care for them when they're sick And it's right to expect that if you're willing to work hard in this country of American Dreamers, the sky is the limit on what you can achieve
It's wrong to tell those brave men and women who are willing to fight and die for this country that when they come home, we may not have room for them at the VA hospitals or the benefits we promised them And it's right to always provide the very best care for the very best of America
My friends, we have not come this far as a people and a nation because we believe that we're better off simply fending for ourselves We are here because we believe that all men are created equal, and that we are all connected to each other as one people And we need to say that more And say it again And keep saying it
And where will our courage come from to speak these truths? When we stand on our own Edmund Pettus Bridge, what hope will sustain us?
I believe it is the hope of knowing that people like John Lewis have stood on that same bridge and lived to cross it
For me, this kind of hope often comes from a memory of a trip I took during the campaign About a week after the primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois And one of the towns we went to was a place called Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late s and early s as having one of the worst racial climates in the country You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families were being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it - it was going on in Cairo
And we're riding down to Cairo and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo It was about  years ago I was  years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to improve the racial climate in Cairo"
And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who takes him to his motel And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice Don't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll report on anything you do"
Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, unpacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who just stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?" and walks away
Well, now Dick is really feeling concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo So I'm wondering what kind of reception we're going to get And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about  people are standing there About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they all are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlier
And as we pull closer, I see something All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for US Senate" And they start smiling And they start waving And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing Because if you told Dick thirty years ago that he - the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St Louis - would be returning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it
But it happened And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it
You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the march finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice" He's right, but you know what? It doesn't bend on its own It bends because we help it bend that way Because people like John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc Thank you John May God Bless you, and may God Bless these United States of America

Mr President, I have come to the floor today to address this pending legislation
This issue should force us to face a fundamental question about who we are as a country, how we progress as a society, and where our values lie as a people:
How do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls when they occur?
Proponents claim this bill is designed to curb the worst abuses of our bankruptcy system That's a worthy goal, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was never meant to serve as a Get Out of Jail Free Card, for use when you've foolishly gambled away all your savings and don't feel like taking responsibility for your actions Business owners and creditors deserve the money they're owed, and anyone who tries to scam the system just because they can should be stopped and forced to pay their debt
But to accomplish that, this bill would take us from a system where judges weed out the abusers from the honest to a system where all the honest are presumed to be abusers Where declaring Chapter  bankruptcy is made prohibitively expensive for people who already have suffered financial devastation With this bill, it doesn't matter if you ran up your debt on a trip to Vegas or a trip to the Emergency Room, you're still treated the same under the law and you still face the possibility that you'll never get the chance to start over
Now, it would be one thing if most people were abusing the system and falling into bankruptcy because they were irresponsible with their finances But we know that's not the case We know that most people fall into bankruptcy as a result of bad luck And we know that a recent Harvard study showed that nearly half of all bankruptcies occur because of an illness that ends up sticking families with medical bills they just can't keep up with
Take the case of Suzanne Gibbons A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a nurse and a home on Chicago's Northwest Side Then she suffered a stroke that left her hospitalized for five-days And even though she had health insurance through her job, it only covered $, of her $, hospital bill
Because of her illness, she was soon forced to leave her full-time nursing job and take a temp job that paid less and didn't offer health insurance Then the collection agencies started coming after her for hospital bills that she just couldn't keep up with She lost her retirement savings, she lost her house, and eventually, she was forced to declare bankruptcy
If this bill passes as written, Suzanne would be treated by the law the same as any scam artist who cheats the system The decision about whether or not she can file for Chapter  bankruptcy would never take into account the fact that she fell into financial despair because of her illness With all that debt, she would have had to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds of dollars more in increased paperwork And after all that, she still may have been told that she was ineligible for Chapter  bankruptcy
And so, as much as we'd like to believe that the face of this bankruptcy crisis is credit card addicts who spend their way into debt, the truth is that it's the face of people like Suzanne Gibbons It's the face of middle-class America Over the last thirty years bankruptcies have gone up % -- and we've had more than , in Illinois just last year We also know what else has gone up: the cost of child care and the cost of college, the cost home ownership and the cost of health care - which is now at a record high People are working harder and longer for less, and they're falling further and further behind
And we're not talking about the poor or even just the working poor here As bankruptcy professor Elizabeth Warren has noted, these are middle-class families with two parents who both work at good-paying jobs that put a roof over their heads They're saving every extra penny they have so that their children can someday do better than they did But with just one illness, emergency, or divorce, those dreams can be wiped out This bill does a great job helping the credit card industry recover the profits they're losing, but what are we doing to help middle-class families recover the dreams they're losing?
This bill does a great job protecting credit card companies from the few bad apples who try to escape their debt, but what does it do to protect the American public from the credit card companies who try to take advantage of them?
Mr President, the bankruptcy crisis this bill should address is not just the one facing credit card companies who are enjoying record profits We should be addressing middle-class families who are dealing with record hardships
As Senator Dodd, Senator Feinstein, and others have pointed out, this bill also fails to deal with the aggressive marketing practices and hidden fees credit card companies have used to raise their profits and our debt Charging a penalty to consumers who make a late payment on a completely unrelated credit card is just one example of these tactics We need to end these practices so that we're making life easier not just for the credit card companies, but for honest, hardworking middle-class families
And if we're going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, we should make it clear that we intend to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable too As it is now, this bill makes it easier for a company like Enron who just bilked their employees out of their life savings to declare bankruptcy than for the employees themselves In my own state, we even had a mining company by the name of Horizon declare bankruptcy and then refuse to pay its employees the health benefits it owed them
The Mine Workers involved had provided a total of , years of service and dedication and sacrifice to this company They spent their lives working hard They did their part But Horizon didn't do its part, and it was allowed to hide behind bankruptcy laws to leave these workers without the care they had earned
This is wrong It's wrong that this bill would make it harder for these unemployed workers to declare bankruptcy, while doing nothing to prevent the bankrupt company that put them there from shirking its responsibility entirely
What kind of a message does it send when we tell hardworking, middle-class Americans, "You have to be more responsible with your finances, but the corporations you work for can be as irresponsible as they want with theirs"?
We must reform our bankruptcy code so that corporations keep their promises and meet their obligations to their workers And while I remain hopeful that our companies want to do the right thing for their workers, doing so should not be a choice - it should be a mandate
Senator Rockefeller has two amendments to do this that I have co-sponsored and urge my colleagues to support One would increase the required payments of wages and employee benefit plans to $, per individual from the current level of $, And it would also require companies that emerge from bankruptcy to immediately pay each retiree who lost health benefits an amount of cash equal to what a retiree would be expected to have to pay for COBRA coverage for  months The second amendment would prevent bankruptcy courts from dismissing companies' coal act obligations to pay their workers the benefits they promised them These companies made a deal to their mine workers, and they should be forced to honor that deal
Mr President, this bill gives us a rare chance to ask ourselves who we're here to protect - who we're here to stand up and speak out for We should curb bankruptcy abuse and to demand a measure of personal responsibility from people We all want that
But there are also millions of middle-class families out there who are struggling to get by They work hard, they love their children, and they're willing to do anything to give them the best possible shot in life And in the ten minutes since I've been talking, about thirty of them have filed for bankruptcy
We live in a rapidly changing world with an economy that's moving just as fast We can't always control this and we can't promise that the changes will always leave everyone better off
But we can do better than one bankruptcy every nineteen seconds We can do better than forcing people to choose between the cost of health care and the cost of college We can do better than big corporations using bankruptcy laws to deny health care and benefits to their employees And we can give people the basic tools and protections they need to believe that in America, your circumstance is no limit to the success you may achieve and the dreams you may fulfill
And so, while I cannot support this bill the way it is written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in amending this bill so that we can still keep that promise alive Thank you
Thank you John Doer It's great to be here with all of you today, and I'm honored that you've given me the opportunity to join this discussion about the role technology can play in our future and our children's future And before we begin, I'd just like to recognize your CEO, Rick White, who is leaving TechNet after years of inspired leadership and service to this organization and this country Thank you Rick
We're here today because when it comes to the global economy, the rules of the game have changed This is a fact not only understood by a roomful of Silicon Valley CEOs, but by families I met all across Illinois during the campaign They know that when it comes to their jobs and their wages, they're not only competing with workers in Naperville and Carbondale, but in New Delhi and Calcutta What's more, they know that when it comes to the high-tech, high skill jobs of the future, their children are not only competing with children here in the United States, but with those on the other side of the globe who are increasingly being educated earlier, longer, and with a special emphasis on the math and science skills required for the industries of tomorrow
These families tell me that they're anxious about their future They worry that they could become the first generation of Americans to see their children do worse than they did They remember that when we were all growing up, our parents knew that if they pushed us to study and work hard, the best universities would be open to us and we could get any job we wanted But today, parents in cities and towns all over America are losing that hope - they're losing the sense that their kids will be able to dream the American dream
The rules of the game have changed And so we must change with them But in a country of innovators and optimists - a country that pioneered the first moon landing, discovered the cure for polio, and led the technological revolution of the nineties - I have no doubt that we can This is the great project for our time, and so it must become a larger part of the debate in our politics, our businesses, our schools and our homes
The good news is that we have the resources, we have the brainpower, and we are still an economic and technological giant In Illinois alone we have , high-tech workers The University of Illinois at Champagne-Urbana is where Marc Andreesen developed Mosaic, the browser that made the World Wide Web what it is today And right now at Argonne National Laboratory, scientists are developing the technology for "grid computing" - which IBM and others believe represents the future of the IT industry
All across America, world-class universities, first-rate research facilities and brilliant minds are on the cusp of discovering the next big idea that will lift up the quality of our lives, create millions of new jobs, and change our world We can take comfort in knowing that, but we can't take it for granted, because right now other countries are looking at places like Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle and saying "we want that" They're investing in better universities, expanding research budgets and venture capital, producing more science and engineering graduates, and passing innovation-friendly public policies
None of us expect or want the government to lead the next technological revolution, but I believe that we can provide the spark that fuels America's innovation and competitiveness in the global economy I believe we can do better than cutting the budget for the National Science Foundation, as this year's budget has done for the first time We can do better than falling to th place in the world when it comes to providing people with access to Broadband We can do better when it comes to using technology to free ourselves from America's dangerous dependence on Mideast oil We can do better than burdening businesses with cases of class action abuse, and that's why I cast a tough vote in favor of reform the other week
And we can do better, think bigger, and act bolder when it comes to education in this country The best part about Bill Gates' speech last week was when he said that our schools are in danger of becoming obsolete as tools to educate tomorrow's workers for tomorrow's jobs But schools are where our children's dreams begin, and so schools are where we must begin to make those dreams come true
We shouldn't wait until high school either We have to start the way Jim Barksdale of Netscape did when he gave a big grant and a lot of hope to preschoolers in Mississippi We can't leave kids behind before they even enter the first grade, and that's why I'll continue to focus on early childhood education as a way to give them the best start in life
We also know that some of the best ideas in education don't come from Washington, but from local schools all over America That's why charter schools are a great way for us to learn from experiments in Topeka and Springfield that schools in Chicago and LA can replicate in their own classrooms And because the success of your businesses depend on your ability to fill jobs with great minds, we need more corporate and private investment in our schools John Doer's work with the New Schools Venture Fund is leading the way on this front, and we should all commend him for that
As parents and citizens, each of us has a stake in making sure that our schools are doing everything possible to give our kids the competitive edge they'll need in a st century economy The tests we have now are great ways to gather information about what works and what doesn't, but they're not enough I believe that to meet tomorrow's challenges, we should create a national network of academies to train , new teachers and get them into high-need rural and urban schools We should give local schools the latest technology training tools as John Chambers has done with the CISCO Networking Academy Program When I was at the University of Chicago, other faculty members and myself developed a program where we essentially adopted primary schools to help them learn how to use the technological opportunities they were being offered It's not enough just to set down a computer in a classroom and walk away - we must also train teachers and administrators on how to use that computer and its technology to find new and better ways of educating our children
Finally, we should work to close the gap that is widening between America and the rest of the world when it comes to math and science graduates
To do this, we must start by inspiring our children with a sense of purposeby nurturing their imagination so that they may dream big and then work hard to reach those dreams Too often, our children spend hours playing Playstation without ever finding out how to build Playstation They watch television but never wonder how it's put together They surf web page after web page on the Internet, but are never taught how to design one
The incredible story of progress that is America has always been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not Our schools must begin instilling that wonder in our children again so that their generation will unite around the next great project of our time, whether it be declaring America energy independent or launching the next great technological revolution
Too often, the debate about education here in Washington degenerates to old arguments and stale ideas And so it's time to put aside partisan differences and just talk about what works for our kids and what will keep America competitive in this new century Those are goals we all have and hopes we all share
Yes, the rules of the game have changed And now it's time for us to prove to the world that we can still play better than anyone The families I've met are ready to try Their kids are ready TechNet is ready And in the coming months, I will do my best to work with my colleagues and make sure our government is ready too I want to thank TechNet for doing your part to get this dialogue going, and now I'd like to take a few questions from the audience Thank youCURE Keynote Address

Thank you David for that warm introduction David is not only one of the most brilliant political minds in the business today, he is a loving husband, a committed father, and a dear friend who I've been honored to have by my side Thank you David for everything you do
I also want to thank Susan Axelrod and the entire leadership of CURE for allowing me the honor of speaking here this evening As many of you know, Susan lives and breathes this organization, from the earliest hours of the morning until late at night, every day of her life And I have no doubt that if the rest of us are willing to offer just a fraction of her level of passion and commitment to this cause, one day we'll be gathered here to finally celebrate a cure
Since I first learned about this organization from David and Susan, I've often thought about the simple act of hope that began its journey
I've thought about three mothers, sitting around a kitchen table, sharing the pain and the helplessness that go along with watching the child you love, the child whose happiness you live for, struggle with a disease that mom and dad can't fix A disease that doesn't necessarily go away with the doctor's medicine, that isn't talked about most nights on the news, that isn't funded and recognized like a lot of the other diseases
But then I also thought about how on that day, those three mothers said "no more" Maybe it was the memory of the first time they saw a seizure take their child to that lonely place where they could no longer reach them Maybe they thought about the  million Americans who suffer from epilepsy, the tens of thousands who succumb to it, and the , more who will be diagnosed this year
Or maybe as they sat around that kitchen table, three friends living similar experiences, they simply realized that there are some challenges in life you can't take on by yourself That there is power and strength in the ability of a community to make a difference And that as that community reaches out and grows and finds its voice, so grows the hope that it will someday find a cure
Well, seven years, thirty research grants, one White House conference, and over $ million in donations later, I can see tonight that the kitchen table has become a lot more crowded and that this community is on its way
And yet despite all the progress, the question still weighing on your minds is, "how do we get all the way there?" How do we get all the way there when, despite the fact that epilepsy affects more Americans than Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and cerebral palsy combined, it still receives far fewer federal research dollars than any of these diseases? How do we get there when too many policy makers and too much of the public still think that epilepsy is, as Brendan Malone told us in the video, an "inconvenience," rather than a serious, and possibly deadly disease?
I think that we get there the same way that so many of you got us here - by continuing to share your stories and your children's stories with the faith that more and more Americans will open their hearts to listen With the faith that if there's a little boy who can't sit through a class without suffering the pain and uncomfortable stares that accompany a seizure, it matters to every mother, even if it's not her son That if there's a young woman who can't work and can't take care of herself and can't have children of her own because of the brain damage caused by epilepsy, it matters to every father, even if it's not his daughter
Personally, I can't begin to imagine what a parent who has a child with epilepsy goes through on a daily basis But I know what it's like to be a parent And as a father with a little girl who suffers from asthma, I can understand the terror you feel when your child wakes you in the middle of the night gasping for air When you would rather stop breathing yourself if it meant that she could start breathing just a little easier
In this way, your stories touch me as both a father and a friend, and I will leave here tonight having adopted your cause as my own, as so many have done before me I will go back to Washington and work with my colleague Rahm Emanuel and others to demand more federal funding for epilepsy research
But I also believe that if each of us walks out of here and tells the story of the  million parents, brothers, sisters, daughters, and sons with epilepsy, it will touch others who may not understand this disease, because they are mothers and fathers and friends too And as they embrace our cause, we will expand this community of concern until there isn't any room left in this country not to listen
This has been the story of CURE ever since its founding - the inspiring idea that those of you who have dedicated so much of yourselves to this cause are doing so knowing full well that a cure may not arrive in time to heal your loved ones And yet, you continue fighting with the hope that you may spare a nameless face the pain your families have known That kind of compassion is heroic, and it is the kind that will eventually defeat this disease
We need this victory now more than ever because today, we face a new threat in the potential spread of epilepsy to thousands more Americans Just last week, USA Today reported that hundreds of US soldiers are returning from Iraq with a condition known as traumatic brain injury, or TBI Even though new technology and better body armor are helping them survive bomb and rocket attacks, the blasts are still causing these soldiers brain damage As of January,  cases have been diagnosed in Army hospitals alone, and some doctors are saying that it could become the "signature wound of the Iraq war"
As some of you may know, TBI is the greatest risk factor for developing epilepsy In fact, a study of Vietnam vets showed that  percent of those who suffered TBI went on to develop the disease
We have asked these brave men and women to leave their homes, leave their families, and fight for our freedom on the other side of the world And now we are finding out that when they come home, they may develop a life-threatening, debilitating disease that this country has not done nearly enough to treat We simply cannot tell our heroes that when it comes to dealing with TBI or epilepsy, they're on their own I know CURE won't, and I will go back to Washington and make sure the federal government won't either I plan to work with my colleagues in Congress to provide the VA with the funds to research TBI and epilepsy so we can learn more about the disease and develop better tools to care for our heroes These soldiers have moms and dads waiting for them at home, they are a part of our community, and we will speak for them
I know that a lot of you have been struggling with epilepsy for a long time now, and that you've seen both good days and bad On the bad days, it may seem like salvation will never come, that parents and children will be suffering with this disease for decades to come
But I think we find hope by remembering that we've been here before That there was a time when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life And just as it seemed that no one was paying attention and nothing could be done, a community of compassion awoke and led a March of Dimes to find the cure for polio
Organized with the help of Franklin Roosevelt and backed by the federal government, the March of Dimes galvanized a nation to conquer polio, dime by dime And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago next month, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine
I know that we don't have a President with epilepsy, or a major celebrity spokesperson, but we do have a growing community that is on the march We have allies in government who know that we can defeat this disease if we work together And we have the hope that every parent has for their child
The hope you have the first time you bring them to the doctor's office, and you just want them to walk out with some medicine and a lollipop The hope you have the first day you watch them get on the bus, when you want them to fit in with the rest of the kids and do well in school The hope you have the day of their first job, when you want them to call you and let you know how great it went The hope you have when they walk down the aisle, when you want nothing more than for them to find love and happiness in life
These are hopes we hold not only for our own children, but for every parent and every child every where And if we leave here tonight determined to turn those hopes into action, into a sustained commitment to fight epilepsy that's more than just about one fundraiser or one benefit, we will find a cure and we will keep hope alive for millions of families for generations to come Thank you, and God Bless youAmerican Legion Legislative Rally
Remarks by Senator Barack Obama
Thank you It's an honor to be here today with all of you Legionnaires Since joining the Veterans Affairs Committee last month, I've been holding town halls with veterans all over Illinois, and I can tell you that in the days ahead, there will be few issues I'll work harder on than ensuring that the brave men and women who serve our country receive the support they deserve and the benefits they've earned when they come home
In the coming weeks, you'll hear a lot of debate over the veterans' budget that President Bush submitted to Congress You'll hear people talk about what we can afford and what adds up on paper, about where we can save money and what percentage increase or decrease we should give to this program or that program
But I know those aren't the first things that came to your mind when you heard about this budget And they're not the first things that came to my mind either
I thought about my grandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after Pearl Harbor He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he came home, it was the education and opportunity offered by the GI Bill that allowed his family to build their own American Dream
I thought about the hundreds of Illinois veterans I've met over the last few years We asked them to leave their homes, leave their families, and risk their lives in some far-off place to protect us And yet, somehow, we're still hearing stories like the one I heard from a veteran named Bill Allen, who told me that on a trip to Chicago, he actually saw homeless veterans fighting over access to the dumpsters That's what I thought about And finally, I thought about a young man named Seamus Ahern, who I met during the campaign at a VFW hall in East Moline, Illinois He told me about how he'd joined the Marines because he was so proud of this country, and he felt that as a young person in his early twenties he wanted to give something back He was getting shipped out to Iraq the following week, and as I listened to him explain why he?d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child But then I asked myself: When Shamus comes home, will we serve him as well as he served us? That's the question we should be asking ourselves when we talk about veterans' benefits and the veterans' budget And that's the standard we should meet
But how do we meet that standard and serve our veterans when we have a budget that, when adjusted for inflation, has even less money for veterans than it did a year ago? When we have less for health care, for hospitals, and for disability pay?
This budget tells our veterans that if you want increased funding for the VA, you'll have to pay for it yourself It's a budget that charges  million veterans a $ enrollment fee just to enter into the health care program they were promised upon enlisting A budget that more than doubles veterans' prescription drug co-payments That will cut $ million in funding for veterans' nursing homes, and will eliminate more than $ million in state grants that are desperately needed by VA facilities across the country
And this is a budget that tells all those veterans still waiting for help to keep waiting There are roughly , compensation and pension claims still unprocessed, but this budget only calls for  new employees to help deal with this backlog ? not enough to make a dent In Chicago, veterans are waiting an average of  days just to start the sometimes decade-long process of getting their disability claim processed  days How can we make our heroes wait this long?
As troops continue to come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the numbers and the need will only increase We know that soldiers are already coming home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we know that a recent Army study showed that one in six soldiers in Iraq reported symptoms of major depression Some experts predict that more than , soldiers may need some kind of mental health treatment when they come home For tens of thousands of others, the wounds they suffered in battle will need care that could last a lifetime
It is not only our patriotic duty to provide this care, it is our moral duty at the most fundamental level When our troops return from battle, we should welcome them with the promise of opportunity, not the threat of poverty
Over half a century ago, it was American Legion National Commander Harry Colmery who first drafted the legislation longhand that would become the GI Bill of Rights ? a bill that has since provided education and training for nearly  million Americans, housing for nearly  million families, and led to the creation of the great American middle-class That was a bill that told our heroes "When you come home, we're here for you, because we're all in this together"
Today, we shouldn't be scraping to find the bare minimum in benefits and health care for our veterans And with the largest deployment of troops since Vietnam fighting for freedom in an increasingly dangerous world, we should be talking about a GI Bill for the st Century
Fortunately, my colleague, Congressman Rahm Emanuel, has just introduced such a bill It's called the Welcome Home Package, and it offers veterans the exact same health care they received during their time in the service, double the education benefit they receive now, and a $, down payment on a home
When veterans look to Congress for help, this is the kind of legislation they should hear about ? not budget cuts and increased fees
It's time to reassess our priorities A budget is more than just a series of numbers on a page; it is an embodiment of our values The President never hesitates to praise the service of our veterans and acknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, and I commend him for that Now I hope he will renew his commitment by increasing funding for the VA, and ensure that our veterans receive more than just words of praise, but also the health care and benefits they?ve earned
George Washington once said: "the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation"
Washington understood then what every veteran here knows now ? that when we make the decision to send our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to speak for them, and to think of them ? always ? when they come Thank you and God Bless you

Mr Chairman and Senator Biden, the position of United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations is one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire US government
Some of the most distinguished Americans - Democrats and Republicans like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, George HW Bush, and Henry Cabot Lodge - have served with honor in this position
Yet, there is one man from my home state of Illinois whose experience as Permanent Representative is quite relevant today
Adlai Stevenson served in this position during the Cuban Missile Crisis And, as we all know, it was Stevenson's presentation to the UN Security Council that proved to the world that the Soviets were moving intermediate range missiles into Cuba Using charts and photos to build a compelling case, Stevenson declared to Soviet Ambassador Zorin that he was prepared to wait "until Hell freezes over" for Zorin's response to the US charges
What few people remember is that Stevenson's presentation came on the heels of what one might call an "intelligence failure" A year earlier, Stevenson had been misled by the White House and the CIA into publicly stating that the United States was not behind the Bay of Pigs invasion Stevenson almost resigned over the incident
This series of events is important to keep in mind today During the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were able to succeed diplomatically because of the stature and integrity of our Permanent Representative to the United Nations In fact, President Kennedy said that, "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our greatest national assets"
As a result, Adlai Stevenson was able to get tough, isolate the Soviets, and convince the world we were right
Today, we face a similar situation With the rest of the world questioning our intelligence capabilities, and nuclear proliferation threats from Iran to North Korea that may require action by the UN Security Council, we must be able to convince the world that we are right Now, more than ever, we need a credible messenger at the UN
Unfortunately, I have some serious reservations about whether Mr Bolton is the right man for the job:
First, senior US intelligence officials have called into question Mr Bolton's credibility on statements he's made about non-proliferation There are also accusations related to political pressure on intelligence analysts who did not agree with Mr Bolton's statements Considering that he's the top arms control official at the State Department, this is troubling to say the least
Second, Mr Bolton's history of inflammatory statements about the UN would seem to make it more difficult for him to advance US interests at the UN I am concerned about whether Mr Bolton even believes the UN is a viable institution and a useful instrument of US foreign policy Saying that it wouldn't make a difference if you lop off ten floors of the UN building in New York isn't exactly the best way to earn people's respect and support - whatever the context
Finally, Mr Bolton appears to have an overly confrontational history with several member-states on the Security Council Like Adlai Stevenson, I believe there are times to be tough But statements like "I don't do carrots" coming from someone who wants to be our chief diplomat at the UN certainly give me pause
Mr Chairman, there is no question that we need someone in New York who is unafraid to shake things up and challenge the status quo But, we also need someone with the credibility, temperament, and diplomatic skill to work with other nations, form coalitions, and advance US interests
That is why I've invoked the memory of Adlai Stevenson here today: he was tough; he was credible; he was diplomatic Most importantly, he was effective Stevenson proved that we should not make compromises or trade-offs when selecting our Representative to the UN
I want to give Mr Bolton a chance to speak on these issues, and so my mind is not made up yet I want to hear from him as to how he can be an effective and credible advocate for the US I look forward to hearing his testimony and answers to the Committee's questions

Mr President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to think about the implications the nuclear option would have on this chamber and this country I urge you to think not just about winning every debate, but about protecting free and democratic debate
During my Senate campaign, I had the privilege and the opportunity to meet Americans from all walks of life and both ends of the political spectrum They told me about their lives, about their hopes, about the issues that mattered to them, and they also told me what they think about Washington
Because you've all heard it yourselves, I know it won't surprise many of you to learn that a lot of people don't think much gets done around here about the issues they care most about They think the atmosphere has become too partisan, the arguments have become too nasty, and the political agendas have become too petty
And while I haven't been here too long, I've noticed that partisan debate is sharp, and dissent is not always well-received Honest differences of opinion and principled compromise often seem to be the victim of a determination to score points against one's opponents
But the American people sent us here to be their voice They understand that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also hope that we can disagree without being disagreeable And at the end of the day, they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business done
What they don't expect is for one party - be it Republican or Democrat - to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster - if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate - then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse
I understand that Republicans are getting a lot of pressure to do this from factions outside the chamber But we need to rise above an "ends justify the means" mentality because we're here to answer to the people - all of the people - not just the ones wearing our party label
The fact is that both parties have worked together to confirm % of this President's judicial nominees The Senate has accepted  of his  selections In fact, we just confirmed another one judge this week by a vote of - Overall, this is a better record than any President's had in the last  years For a President who received % of the vote and a Senate chamber made up of % of the President's party, I'd say that confirming % of your judicial nominations is a record I'd be pretty happy with
Again, I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules In the long run, this is not a good result for either party One day Democrats will be in the majority again, and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority
Mr President, I sense that talk of the nuclear option is more about power than about fairness I believe some of my colleagues propose this rules change because they can get away with it rather than because they know it's good for our democracy
Right now, we're faced with rising gas prices, skyrocketing tuition costs, a record number of uninsured Americans, and some of the most serious national security threats we've ever had, all while our bravest young men and women are risking their lives halfway around the world to keep us safe
These are challenges we all want to meet and problems we all want to solve, even if we don't all agree how to do it But if the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who asked us to be their voice, I fear that the already partisan atmosphere of Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything That doesn't serve anyone's best interests, and it certainly isn't what the patriots who founded this democracy had in mind
We owe the people who sent us here more than that We owe them much more
Thank you

Congratulations! After four long years of endless studying, sleepless nights, and constant stress, who's ready to kick back, relax, and jump head first into their residency?
And who wishes people would stop making that joke? I thought so
It's an honor to be back here at the University of Chicago As most of you know, I used to teach over at the law school and my wife Michelle is in charge of community affairs at the hospital, so as a part of the family we're especially proud of you all right now
We're also especially hopeful With the caliber of talent and amazing dedication represented here today, I found myself thinking that in one of these chairs could sit the researcher who will finally win humanity's long battle against cancer In one of these chairs could sit the scientist who transforms AIDS from one of the greatest disasters of the th century to one of the most curable diseases of the st In one of these chairs could sit the doctor who says "Hey Barack, don't worry about that trick knee - you're just getting old" So that's hopeful too
But this hope that I have for your class - this faith in our ability to overcome that which threatens to halt the march of human progress - is nothing new It is as old as our history and as powerful as the idea of America itself And that's because we've been here before
Almost eighty years ago, when the University of Chicago's first graduating class sat here ready to collect their diplomas, who would have dared to believe that before the beginning of the next century, we would add thirty years to the average lifespan and witness a % drop in the rate of infant death? Who would have dared to believe that with a simple vaccine, we could eliminate a disease that left millions without the ability to walk? That we could transplant a heart or resuscitate one that stopped? That we could unlock the greatest mysteries of life from the most basic building blocks of our existence?
In a time where you were lucky to live past fifty and doomed if you came down with the flu, who would have dared to believe these things?
The people who once sat in your chairs - they did The doctors and nurses, researchers and scientists who came before Who grew up believing that in America, the most improbable of all experiments, the place where we continue to defy the odds and write our own history, they could be the ones to improve, extend, and save human life They could be the healers
As this new century unfolds, their success and your potential have led us to a moment of unparalleled promise in health and medicine Just like a century ago, technology and treatments that were once barely imagined are now imminently possible
Yet, while these are some of tomorrow's biggest potential breakthroughs, they are not today's biggest medical challenge Today, as we continue to find new ways to live longer and better, the greatest single threat to the health of our nation is not a scarcity of genius or a failure of discovery; it is a lack of collective will to ensure that every single American has access to effective, affordable health care It is our inability, after years and years of talk and gridlock, to finally do something about the crushing cost of health care in America
This has long stopped being about a single issue that politicians bring up during an election year This is now a national crisis
 million Americans are uninsured - over  million more in the last four years This isn't just a moral shame, it's an economic disaster that's catching Americans in a vicious cycle Because the uninsured can't afford health care, they put off seeing a doctor or end up in the ER when they get sick Then their care is more expensive, and so premiums for all Americans go up - to the tune of $ a family Because everyone's premiums go up, more Americans lose their health care
All the while, costs just keep climbing and climbing Family premiums are up by nearly % over the last five years Deductibles are up % Co-payments for care and prescriptions are through the roof From the smallest mom and pop stores to major corporations like GM, businesses who can't afford these rising costs cut back on insurance, workers, or both States with bigger Medicaid bills and smaller budgets are being forced to choose whether they want their citizens to be unhealthy or uneducated And over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills
The cost crisis is affecting your profession too Whether it's Medicaid reimbursements, the rising price of medical malpractice insurance, or having HMOs look over your shoulder, all the hard work and sacrifice you've put in during medical school isn't as rewarding as it once was
So now, just like generations before, you must dare to believe - not only as tomorrow's physicians, but as tomorrow's parents, workers, business owners, and citizens You must choose: Will the groundbreaking miracles you discover over the next generation reach only the luckiest few? Or will history look back at this moment as the time when we finally made care available at a cost that won't bring the world's largest economy to its knees?
For you guys, this is about more than just the statistics and the numbers Part of the philosophy of the Pritzker School of Medicine has always been the recognition that "medicine does not exist in a social vacuum" Living here over the last four years, you've seen this Surrounding us right now on the south side of Chicago are poor kids sitting in those ERs who could never afford a physical Children suffering from adult diabetes because parents can't afford to provide the proper nutrition Worried mothers thumbing through checkbooks, not knowing if they can pay for this month's medicine
There isn't one person sitting here today who wants to turn a sick patient away because they can't pay Not one person who wants the cure they discover denied to those whose lives depend on it Each of you has dedicated yourselves to this calling because where there is a sick person, you want to heal them Where there is a life in jeopardy, you want to save it
And so today, when you leave here, it will not only be with great knowledge, but with even greater responsibility Because if we do nothing about the rising cost of health care, experts believe that in ten years, the number of uninsured will grow to  million And if we do nothing to expand access to the uninsured, costs will keep rising
But while this is a national crisis, it still isn't part of the national conversation It's an issue where we haven't seen any leadership over the last four years; an issue that Washington continues to duck We just spent three entire weeks arguing over the filibuster, but I can count on one hand the number of times we've talked about health care since I was sworn in last January Yet, when I come back here and talk to families in Illinois, that's all they tell me about
This isn't just limited to one party either In part, the fear of reform stems from the experience President Clinton had in the early 's when he recognized the emerging health care crisis and sought a comprehensive answer For that, he deserves great credit
But the resulting political firestorm, fanned by the insurance lobby and other powerful interests who had a stake in maintaining the status quo, badly singed the Clinton Administration
Since then, health care continues to be fodder for candidates, but quickly recedes into the background when elections come and go
And with each passing year, the problem grows and the solutions become more difficult
We cannot turn our heads any longer
Challenging as it is, fixing the health care system is not an impossible problem to solve I'm not saying it will be easy, or that all the solutions are right in front of us We may not be able to build consensus on every detail right away, but where we do agree, we should act now to bring down skyrocketing costs
One place to start is by bringing the health care system into the st century In our lifetimes, we've seen some of the greatest advances in the history of technology and the sharing of information Yet, you're about to enter a profession where too much care is still provided with a pen and paper Where too much information about patients isn't shared between doctors or readily available to them in the first place And where we still don't have the information to know what care has worked most effectively and efficiently to make patients healthy
For too many Americans, the time lost as a result of archaic record-keeping has been the margin between life and death
But embracing st century technology is not just about reducing errors and improving the quality of medical care It's also about cost
We spend nearly one and a half trillion dollars a year on health care in America But a quarter of that money - one out of every four dollars - is spent on non-medical costs; most of it bills and paperwork Nearly every other industry in the world has saved billions on these administrative costs by doing it all online Every transaction you make at a bank now costs them less than a penny Even at the Veterans Administration, where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record, new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for free
Yet, because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a single transaction still costs up to twenty-five dollars - not one dime of which goes toward improving the quality of our health care Doctors are forced to fumble through paperwork and don't have all of the information about each patient at the click of a mouse Mistakes are easily made and today, patients are given the right kind of care only half of the time In fact, a recent study showed that medical error alone kills up to , people a year - that's more than die from AIDS each year This is due not only to outdated medical technology, but the fact that we don't have a health care system that measures the quality of care patients are provided - that tells us what works, what doesn't, and where mistakes were made
But by bringing our health care system on-line, we could start improving the quality of care and cutting the cost of it We could save thousands of lives and save families billions of dollars Just imagine if every doctor and nurse could sit by a patient's bedside with a laptop and pull up their entire medical history - information from every past doctor they've seen - with the click of a mouse If every patient had an electronic bracelet that you could scan to find out the exact type and amount of medication they needed so there were no mistakes made If you could go on-line and monitor a patient's breathing and heart rate while they were home to track their recovery
We know all of this possible - so what are we waiting for? It's time for this country to start taking on the big challenges and asking the big questions again Why couldn't we help every health care provider who does business with the federal government that they need to convert their entire system to electronic transactions? Why couldn't we help connect our hospitals so they could share technology and information about what works and what doesn't? This way we could start creating a virtual system of health care in America where knowledge about each individual's health needs and health history is readily available to every single person who provides them care
And while we're at it, why couldn't we start rewarding the quality of care and the effort to prevent disease instead of only rewarding treatment itself? This way there would be actual incentives to provide good care and it would cut down on wasteful spending on the wrong kind of care As tomorrow's doctors, you can help here too by making sure that all the drugs you prescribe aren't just the latest pharmaceutical fad, but the cheapest and most effective medicine for your patients
So why couldn't we do all of this? The answer is, we can We can bring down the cost of health care in America and insure every American, and your generation can lead the way
Of course, no one's forcing you to meet these challenges Each of you has been blessed with extraordinary gifts and talent And so if you want, you can leave here and focus on your own medical career and your own success, not giving another thought to the plight of the growing millions who can't afford the care you will provide After all, there is no community service requirement in the real world; and no one's forcing you to care
But I hope that you do Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt Not because you have an obligation to those are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation You need to take on the challenges that your country is facing because you have an obligation to yourself Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential
Looking out at this class of , I think my hope is well-placed With the field you have chosen, you've already shown how much you care about the lives of others; how strongly you have heard the calling to be healers in this world Today, I ask you to remember that call always, and to remember how it could include more than the patient sitting in your office It could also include the patients who can't afford to get there, the ones who aren't being provided the best care, and the general health of all Americans
When you think about these challenges, I also ask you to remember that in this country, our history of overcoming the seemingly impossible always comes about because individuals who care really can make a difference America is great because Americans are good
And as you go forth from here in your own life, you can keep this history alive if you only find the courage to try Good luck with this journey, and congratulations on all of your achievements Thank you

Mr President, today I am offering an amendment to the fiscal year  Emergency Supplemental, which I am pleased to announce is being cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Bingaman, and Graham This amendment would meet certain needs of our injured service members in recognition of the tremendous sacrifices they have made in defense of our country
The other day I had the opportunity to visit some of our wounded heroes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center
I know that many of my colleagues have made the same trip and I'd heard about their visits, but there is nothing that can fully prepare you for what you see when you take that first step into the Physical Therapy room
These are kids in there Our kids The ones we watched grow up The ones we hoped would live lives that were happy, healthy, and safe These kids left their homes and families for a dangerous place halfway around the world After years of being protected by their parents, these kids risked their lives to protect us
And now, some of them have come home from that war with scars that may change their lives forever - scars that may never heal And yet they sit there in that hospital, so full of hope and still so proud of their country
These kids are the best of America They deserve our highest respect, and they deserve our help
Recently, I learned that some of our most severely wounded soldiers are being forced to pay for their own meals and their own phone calls while being treated in medical hospitals
Up until last year, there was a law on the books that prohibited soldiers from receiving both their basic subsistence allowance and free meals from the military Basically, this law allowed the government to charge our wounded heroes for food while they were recovering from their war injuries
Thankfully, this body acted to change this law in  so that wounded soldiers wouldn't have to pay for their meals
But, we're dealing with a bureaucracy here, and as we all know, nothing is ever simple in a bureaucracy So now, because the Department of Defense doesn't consider getting physical therapy or rehabilitation services in a medical hospital as "being hospitalized," there are wounded veterans who still do not qualify for the free meals other veterans receive And after  days, even those classified as hospitalized on an outpatient status lose their free meals as well
Also, while our soldiers in the field qualify for free phone service, injured service men and women who may be hospitalized hundreds or thousands of miles from home do not receive this benefit
For soldiers whose family members aren't able to take off work and travel to a military hospital, hearing the familiar voice of a mom or dad or husband or wife on the other side of the phone can make all the difference in the world
And yet, our government will not help pay for these calls And it will not help pay for those meals
Think about that Think about the sacrifice these kids have made for their country, many of them literally risking life and sacrificing limb
And now, at $ a meal, they could end up with a $ bill from the government that sent them to war every single month This is wrong, and we have a moral obligation to fix it
The first amendment that I'm offering today will do this It will expand the group of "hospitalized" soldiers who cannot be charged for their meals to include those service members undergoing medical recuperation, therapy or otherwise on "medical hold" The number of people affected by this amendment will be small Only about  service members are estimated to fall under the category of "non-hospitalized"
The amendment is retroactive to January , , in an effort to provide those injured service members who may have received bills for their meals with some relief from those costs The amendment will also extend free phone service to those injured service members who are hospitalized or otherwise undergoing medical recuperation or therapy I am proud that this amendement is supported by the American Legion, and I hope my colleagues will join them in that support
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment These are our kids out there, and they're risking their lives for us When they come home with injuries, the government that asked these kids to serve should provide them with the best possible care and support This is a small price to pay for those who have sacrificed so much for their country
I thank the Senior Senator from Alaska and my colleague from Mississippi for working with me on this issue I am hopeful we can reach an agreement on this

Let me congratulate all of those who have helped to make this wonderful vision a reality
But we gather here today not to celebrate a building We gather to celebrate a man
What is it that makes Lincoln such a seminal figure in our story? How is it that this man, born in the backwoods of Kentucky, with little formal education, homely and awkward, a man given to depression and wracked with self-doubt, might come to represent so much of who we are as a people, and so much of what we aspire to be?
Some of it has to do with the trajectory of his life In his rise from poverty, his self-study and ultimate mastery of language and of law, in his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat - in all of this we see a fundamental element of the American character, a belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams
Some of it has to do with the sheer energy of the man, the railsplitter, ax-in-hand, looking out at a frontier of hope and possibility Lincoln believed deeply in the American spirit of innovation and exploration that accepts no limits to the heights to which our nation might reach
In all of this - the repeated acts of self-creation, the insistence that with sweated brow and calloused hands and focused will we can recast the wilderness of the American landscape and the American heart into something better, something finer - in all of this Lincoln embodies our deepest myths It is a mythology that drives us still
And yet what separates Lincoln from the other great men has to do with something else It's an issue of character that speaks to us, of moral resolve Lincoln was not a perfect man, nor a perfect president By modern standards, his condemnation of slavery might be considered tentative; his Emancipation Proclamation more a military document than a clarion call for justice He wasn't immune to political considerations; his temperament could be indecisive and morose
And yet despite these imperfections, despite his fallibilityindeed, perhaps because of a painful self-awareness of his own failings, etched in every crease of his face and reflected in those haunted eyesbecause of this essential humanity of his, when it came time to confront the greatest moral challenge this nation has ever faced, Lincoln did not flinch He did not equivocate or duck or pass the challenge on to future generations He did not demonize the fathers and sons who did battle on the other side, nor seek to diminish the terrible costs of his war In the midst of slavery's dark storm and the complexities of governing a house divided, he kept his moral compass pointed firm and true
It serves us then to reflect on whether that element of Lincoln's character, and the American character - that aspect which makes tough choices, and speaks the truth when least convenient, and acts while still admitting doubt - remains with us today Lincoln once said that "character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing"
At a time when image all too often trumps substance, when our politics all too often feeds rather than bridges division, when the prospects of a poor youth rising out of poverty seem of no consequence to the powerful, and when we evoke our common God to condemn those who do not think as we do, rather than to seek God's mercy for our own lack of understanding - at such a time it is helpful to remember this man who was the real thing Lincoln reminds us that our essential greatness is not the shadow of sophistication or popularity, or wealth or power or fleeting celebrity It is the tree that stands in the face of our doubts and fears and bigotries, and insists we can do better
Today we come to celebrate not a building but a man And as that man called once upon the better angels of our nature, so is he calling still, across the ages, to summon some measure of that character, his character, in each of us, today

Thank you It's always great to be here in Carbondale, and a real honor to speak here at SIUC's first Agriculture Industry Day
Now, I'll be honest - I haven't done all that much farming living on the South Side of Chicago But I have to say, my fondest farming memory is when I once offered to help out a friend with his harvest Knowing the full range of my agricultural experience and expertise, he took one look at me and said"no thanks"
So when I saw that you guys needed a keynote speaker for a lecture entitled, "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois," I said "sign me up"
But seriously, while I don't farm, what I did do during my eight years in the Illinois State Senate, and what I'm doing now as a Senator in Washington, is to constantly listen and learn from people who do farm and who do know the business And that has helped me tremendously in figuring out how I can best stand up and speak out on the issues that matter to family farmers and to the future of agriculture in this country
Thanks to all the hard work you're doing here at SIU, that future holds more promise and more potential for America with each passing day Because in a world where globalization has made it possible for a student in Carbondale to share ideas with one in Calcutta, yet necessary for them to compete for the same jobs, the advances you're making in agriculture could lead to the breakthroughs we need to maintain America's global leadership in the years to come
This is our new challenge for the new century - and it's different than anything we've ever faced before
Just think about what the world was like only fifty years ago, when the College of Agriculture was a small, five-man department that taught its students in a few old army barracks Back then, the big challenge was navigating the soils found in the hills and valleys of southern Illinois If you could master that, you were ready to graduate and live the farming life, knowing that it would be enough to provide for you and your family
And even if you didn't go to a fine school like SIU, in those days you still had a shot at the American Dream Because whether it was on the farm or in a factory, a middle-class job that paid a decent wage and good benefits was easy to come by - and it would probably last you a lifetime Hard work and sacrifice paid off for most families, and because of the wealth they built, America's economic leadership was unchallenged
But the world has certainly changed since then, hasn't it?
Today, even a college degree doesn't guarantee a middle-class job that will support a family What's worse, the cost of getting that degree and the price of health care on that job are rising higher and faster than ever before Family farmers are being squeezed by big agribusiness, and factory jobs are heading across the ocean where labor is cheap
We can make sure that the new jobs and new industries that take their place stay in America - but it won't happen by itself Countries like India and China are churning out more and more qualified college graduates who can compete directly with Americans for jobs that can now be done anywhere in the world If we want to stay on top, we'll need a nationwide commitment to better education, better training, and the research and discovery that have always made America a land of innovation and optimism
This is where you guys come in
The title of this lecture - "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois" - is really too narrow to capture the full potential of the work you're doing here at the College of Agriculture Fifty years ago, it may have only been about the economy in southern Illinois Fifty years ago, the work you're doing may not have had an impact beyond the farms and borders of a small town like Carbondale
But today we live in a different world
Today, a discovery made right here in your Food and Nutrition department could save a person from a lifetime of diabetes in southern California An SIU student who publishes a paper online about the benefits of soy in preventing prostate cancer could attract the attention of a researcher in Boston who's working on a cure And a professor who makes a breakthrough in developing drought-resistant crops could save millions from hunger in Africa
Today, the work you're doing here not only has the potential to improve the lives of people in Illinois and across the world; it offers the opportunity to develop new ideas that will lead to new jobs and a new competitive edge for America in the st century This is the way we can win in the global economy, and here at this school in this Illinois small town, you're helping us get there
Right now, researchers at this college are studying ways to improve the production and efficiency of ethanol Again, this may sound small, but just imagine what this could do for our country
Any of you who've pulled into a gas station lately have noticed how high the prices are getting You might have decided to drive your car less, or you might have noticed that the cost of gas is cutting into your family budget The price of oil has now climbed to a record of over $ a barrel, and we don't even know how much worse it's going to get
So what do we do about this?
We only have % of the world's oil reserves - % of our oil is imported from the Middle East So unless we want to stay dependent forever on a region of the world that's dangerous, politically unstable, and willing to do lord-knows-what with the price of oil, we must find new sources of energy here in America
It seems like politicians have been saying this forever But when you look at the record gas prices, and the possibility for more war and turmoil in the Middle East, it's clear that we need less talk and more action
We can start by producing more ethanol in America
The future of energy in this country doesn't have to remain in the deserts of the Middle East; we can find it in the corn fields of Illinois and across the Midwest
Imagine running our cars with a fuel we can literally grow as much as we want of Imagine using a fuel that's clean and healthy, that's selling for  cents cheaper than gasoline, and that places America's energy needs in America's hands
This kind of future is here - but to expand ethanol's promise across the nation, you guys need to keep up the great research here and we need to step up the legislative process in Washington
Recently, I joined a few other Senators in introducing a bill that would increase America's renewable fuel standard and increase ethanol production along with it A bill like this that's already passed the Senate twice would've provided us with , barrels a day of refined ethanol for use in gasoline and would save us $ billion every year in imported oil and gasoline costs
Just think of what this would do for our economy Farmers would earn more for their corn, businesses would invest more in the type of community-sized ethanol facilities that would grow the downstate economy, and over , jobs would be created We've got bipartisan support for this bill, so I'm pretty confident that this is the year we're finally going to get it done
The other ethanol bill I've introduced would make it easier for more cars to be powered by cheaper, cleaner, ethanol-based fuel As most of you probably know, there's a fuel known as E that's made from % ethanol and % gasoline It's a great alternative to gasoline, but the only problem is that we're in short supply of E fueling stations Down here in southern Illinois, you drive by miles and miles of corn fields that can produce ethanol, but only  E stations in all of southern Illinois, and not one in Carbondale So the bill I'm sponsoring would provide a tax credit of % to anyone who wants to build an E fuel station And to give consumers a good deal too, it'll provide a tax credit of  cents per gallon of E fuel We've talked for too long about energy independence in this country, and I think these proposals finally give us an opportunity to do something about it You've all been doing your part here at SIU, and it's high time for Washington to do our part
I've always believed that the incredible story of progress that is America has been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not - questions asked by the very students at this college every day they choose to confront the challenges of this new century It is this fundamental character of the American spirit - the desire to move forward, look around the next corner, and reach for the unreachable - that put the first man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched the technological revolution of the nineties
And as the College of Agriculture looks ahead to its next fifty years, we'd do well to ask ourselves "What will they say about us at the th anniversary?" As we face a new and different world that brings both great promise and great peril, what will we do move America towards a new and better day?
You won't find the answers from your professors - and certainly not from politicians You'll find them by continuing to ask yourselves those questions - why, what if, and why not And as you keep studying and researching here at school, remember that the answers you discover will not only have an impact where you live and learn, but across a world that is just waiting to hear from the next generation of dreamers Thank you

I rise today to speak on the nomination of California Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals Now, let me begin by saying that the last thing I would like to be spending my time on right now is talking about judges
I am sure that is true for many in this Chamber I know that I certainly do not hear about filibusters and judges when I go back to Illinois and hold townhall meetings with people across the State What I hear about are veterans who are concerned about their disability payments and families who are talking about how high gas prices were or how difficult it is to pay for college And so I think this argument we have been having over the last several weeks about judicial nominations has been an enormous distraction from some of the work that is most important to the American people
Moreover, I am not so naive as to think that speaking to an empty Chamber for the benefit of C-SPAN is somehow going to change people's minds or people's votes I recognize that most of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, are fairly locked into their positions I do not expect the President to appoint many judges of my liking One of the things I have told some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle is that there is only one sure way to make sure Democrats are able to block what they consider to be bad judges, and that is to win elections
And yet I feel compelled to rise on this issue to express, in the strongest terms, my opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit
I think it is important for the American people to know just what it is we are getting After the Supreme Court, as my esteemed colleague from Wisconsin just stated, the DC Circuit is widely viewed as the second highest court in the land Three of our current Supreme Court Justices came directly from this court Under its jurisdiction fall laws relating to all sorts of Federal agencies and regulations This is a special court It has jurisdiction that other appeals courts do not have The judges on this court are entrusted with the power to make decisions affecting the health of the environment, the amount of money we allow in politics, the right of workers to bargain for fair wages and find freedom from discrimination, and the Social Security that our seniors will receive It is because of this power that we deserve to give the American people a qualified judicial nominee to serve on the DC Circuit
Now, the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not simply whether they are intelligent Some of us who attended law school or are in business know there are a lot of real smart people out there whom you would not put in charge of stuff The test of whether a judge is qualified to be a judge is not their intelligence It is their judgment
The test of a qualified judicial nominee is also not whether that person has their own political views Every jurist surely does The test is whether he or she can effectively subordinate their views in order to decide each case on the facts and the merits alone That is what keeps our judiciary independent in America That is what our Founders intended
Unfortunately, as has been stated repeatedly on this floor, in almost every legal decision that she has made and every political speech that she has given, Justice Brown has shown she is not simply a judge with very strong political views, she is a political activist who happens to be a judge It is a pretty easy observation to make when you look at her judicial decisions While some judges tend to favor an activist interpretation of the law and others tend to believe in a restrained interpretation of the law providing great deference to the legislature, Justice Brown tends to favor whatever interpretation leads her to the very same ideological conclusions every single time
So when it comes to laws protecting a woman's right to choose or a worker's right to organize, she will claim that the laws that the legislature passed should be interpreted narrowly Yet when it comes to laws protecting corporations and private property, she has decided that those laws should be interpreted broadly When the rights of the vulnerable are at stake, then she believes the majority has the right to do whatever it wants When the minority happens to be the minority of people who have privilege and wealth, then suddenly she is countermajoritarian and thinks it is very important to constrain the will of the majority
Let me just give you a couple examples In a case reviewing California's parental notification law, Justice Brown criticized the California Supreme Court decision overturning that law, saying that the court should have remained "tentative, recognizing the primacy of legislative prerogatives" She has also repeatedly tried to overturn the fact that California law recognizes Tameny claims, a line of cases that establishes that an employer does not have an unfettered right to fire an employee, but that the right has limits according to fundamental public policy She says judicial restraint is critical She claims that public policy is "a function first and foremost reserved to the legislature"
So on these cases dealing with a woman's right to choose, worker protections, punitive damages, or discrimination, she wants the judge to stay out of the legislative decisionmaking process But Justice Brown doesn't always want the courts to exercise restraint and defer to the legislature When Justice Brown wanted to limit the ability of juries to punish companies that engage in severe discrimination, a fellow judge on the California Supreme Court accused her of engaging in "judicial law making" Instead of denying it, Justice Brown defended her judicial activism She called it creativity This is what she said: "All judges make law It is arrogance, carelessness and a lack of candor that constitute impermissible judicial practice, not creativity"
Justice Brown has also gone out of her way to use her position in the courts to advocate for increased protections for property owners In a case about a developer that wanted to break a city rent control law, Justice Brown dismissed the fact that a majority of the city's voters had approved of that law and thought that the case should be an exception to the philosophy of narrow judicial review Justice Brown believed that this case was one in which "some degree of judicial scrutiny is appropriate" Which is it, Justice Brown? In some cases you think we should defer to the legislature and in some cases, apparently, you think it is appropriate for judges to make law What seems to distinguish these two types of cases is who the plaintiff is, who the claimant is
If the claimant is powerful -- if they are a property owner, for example -- then she is willing to use any tool in her judicial arsenal to make sure the outcome is one they like If it is a worker or a minority claiming discrimination, then she is nowhere to be found
Judicial decisions ultimately have to be based on evidence and on fact They have to be based on precedent and on law When you bend and twist all of these to cramp them into a conclusion you have already made -- a conclusion that is based on your own personal ideology -- you do a disservice to the ideal of an independent judiciary and to the American people who count on an independent judiciary
Because of this tendency, and because of her record, it seems as if Justice Brown's mission is not blind justice but political activism The only thing that seems to be consistent about her overarching judicial philosophy in an unyielding belief in an unfettered free market and a willingness to consistently side with the powerful over the powerless
Let's look at some of her speeches outside of the courtroom In speech after speech, she touts herself as a true conservative who believes that safety nets -- such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and health care -- have "cut away the very foundation upon which the Constitution rests"
Justice Brown believes, as has already been stated in the Chamber, that the New Deal, which helped save our country and get it back on its feet after the Great Depression, was a triumph of our very own "Socialist revolution" She has equated altruism with communism She equates even the most modest efforts to level life's playing field with somehow inhibiting our liberty
For those who pay attention to legal argument, one of the things that is most troubling is Justice Brown's approval of the Lochner era of the Supreme Court In the Lochner case, and in a whole series of cases prior to Lochner being overturned, the Supreme Court consistently overturned basic measures like minimum wage laws, child labor safety laws, and rights to organize, deeming those laws as somehow violating a constitutional right to private property The basic argument in Lochner was you can't regulate the free market because it is going to constrain people's use of their private property Keep in mind that that same judicial philosophy was the underpinning of Dred Scott, the ruling that overturned the Missouri Compromise and said that it was unconstitutional to forbid slavery from being imported into the free States That same judicial philosophy essentially stopped every effort by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to overcome the enormous distress and suffering that occurred during the Great Depression It was ultimately overturned because Justices, such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, realized that if Supreme Court Justices can overturn any economic regulation -- Social Security, minimum wage, basic zoning laws, and so forth -- then they would be usurping the rights of a democratically constituted legislature Suddenly they would be elevated to the point where they were in charge as opposed to democracy being in charge
Justice Brown, from her speeches, at least, seems to think overturning Lochner was a mistake She believes the Supreme Court should be able to overturn minimum wage laws She thinks we should live in a country where the Federal Government cannot enforce the most basic regulations of transparency in our security markets, that we cannot maintain regulations that ensure our food is safe and the drugs that are sold to us have been tested It means, according to Justice Brown, that local governments or municipalities cannot enforce basic zoning regulations that relieve traffic, no matter how much damage it may be doing a particular community
What is most ironic about this is that what Justice Brown is calling for is precisely the type of judicial activism that conservatives have been railing against for the last  years
Supreme Court Justice Scalia is not somebody with whom I frequently agree I do not like a lot of his judicial approaches, but at least the guy is consistent Justice Scalia says that, generally speaking, the legislature has the power to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution That is not Justice Brown's philosophy It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to do what you want with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document
It would be one thing if these opinions were confined to her political speeches The fact is she has carried them over into her judicial decisionmaking That is why the California State Bar Association rated her as "unqualified" to serve on the State's highest court That is why not one member of the American Bar Association found her to be very qualified to serve on the DC Circuit, and why many members of the bar association found her not qualified at all
It is also why conservative commentators, such as Andrew Sullivan and George Will, while agreeing with her political philosophy, simply do not see how she can be an effective judge Here is what Sullivan said:
She does not fit the description of a judge who simply follows the law If she isn't a "judicial activist," I don't know who would be
Sullivan added that he is in agreement with some of her conservative views but thinks "she should run for office, not the courts"
Columnist George Will, not known to be a raving liberal, added recently that he believes Justice Brown is out of the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence
Let me wrap up by making mention of a subtext to this debate As was true with Clarence Thomas, as was true with Alberto Gonzales, as was true with Condoleezza Rice, my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time during this debate discussing Justice Brown's humble beginnings as a child of a sharecropper They like to point out she was the first African American to serve on the California Supreme Court
I, too, am an admirer of Justice Brown's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Alberto Gonzales's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Clarence Thomas's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Condoleezza Rice's rise from modest means I think it is wonderful We should all be grateful where opportunity has opened the doors of success for Americans of every background
Moreover, I am not somebody who subscribes to the view that because somebody is a member of a minority group they somehow have to subscribe to a particular ideology or a particular political party I think it is wonderful that Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and others are represented in all parties and across the political spectrum When such representation exists, then those groups are less likely to be taken for granted by any political party
I do not think that because Justice Brown is an African-American woman she has to adhere to a particular political orthodoxy, something that has been suggested by the other side of the aisle Just as it would be cynical and offensive that Justice Brown be vilified simply for being a Black conservative, it is equally offensive and cynical to suggest that somehow she should get a pass for her outlandish views simply because she is a Black woman
I hope we have arrived at a point in our country's history where Black folks can be criticized for holding views that are out of the mainstream, just as Whites are criticized when they hold views that are out of the mainstream I hope we have come to the point where a woman can be criticized for being insensitive to the rights of women, just as men are criticized when they are insensitive to the rights of women
Unfortunately, Justice Brown's record on privacy and employment discrimination indicates precisely such an insensitivity
I will give one example In a case where a group of Latino employees at Avis Rent A Car was subjected to repeated racial slurs in the workplace by another employee, the lower court found that Avis, in allowing this to go on, had created a hostile environment Justice Brown disagreed with and criticized the decision
In her opinion, she wrote that racially discriminatory speech in the workplace, even when it rises to the level of illegal race discrimination, is still protected by the first amendment This was despite US Supreme Court opinions that came to the exact opposite conclusion
Justice Brown went so far as to suggest that the landmark civil rights law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of , could be unconstitutional under the first amendment
I believe if the American people could truly see what was going on here they would oppose this nomination, not because she is African American, not because she is a woman, but because they fundamentally disagree with a version of America she is trying to create from her position on the bench It is social Darwinism, a view of America that says there is not a problem that cannot be solved by making sure that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer It requires no sacrifice on the part of those of us who have won life's lottery and does not consider who our parents were or the education received or the right breaks that came at the right time
Today, at a time when American families are facing more risk and greater insecurity than they have in recent history, at a time when they have fewer resources and a weaker safety net to protect them against those insecurities, people of all backgrounds in America want a nation where we share life's risks and rewards with each other And when they make laws that will spread this opportunity to all who are willing to work for it, they expect our judges to uphold those laws, not tear them down because of their political predilections Republican, Democrat, or anyone in between Those are the types of judges the American people deserve Justice Brown is not one of those judges I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this nomination

Thank you It's an honor to be here with the hundreds of dedicated librarians who make up the American Library Association Before we begin, I'd like to say a special hello to ALA member Nancy Gibbs, who is the mother of my communications director, Robert Gibbs Believe me, I have no idea how the biggest mouth in our office came from a family of two librarians, but we're proud to have him on board and I'm sure you are too
I'd also like to give a shout-out to my librarians from the Punahou School in Hawaii - Molly Lyman, Joan Kaaua, and Lillian Hiratani I'd like to offer them an apology too, for all those times I couldn't keep myself out of trouble and ended up sitting in their library on a timeout, trying to cause even more trouble there Sorry ladies
It is a pleasure to address you today because of what libraries represent More than a building that houses books and data, the library has always been a window to a larger world - a place where we've always come to discover big ideas and profound concepts that help move the American story forward
And at a time when truth and science are constantly being challenged by political agendas and ideologies; a time where so many refuse to teach evolution in our schools, where fake science is used to beat back attempts to curb global warming or fund life-saving research; libraries remind us that truth isn't about who yells the loudest, but who has the right information Because even as we're the most religious of people, America's innovative genius has always been preserved because we also have a deep faith in facts
And so the moment we persuade a child, any child, to cross that threshold into a library, we've changed their lives forever, and for the better This is an enormous force for good
So I'm here to gratefully acknowledge the importance of libraries and the work you do I also want to work with you to insure that libraries continue to be sanctuaries for learning, where we are free to read and consider what we please, without the fear of Big Brother peering menacingly over our shoulders
Now, some of you might have heard about this speech I gave at the Democratic Convention last summer It ended up making some news here and there, and one of the lines that people seem to remember was when I said that "We don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States"
What many people don't remember is that for years, librarians are the ones who've been on the frontlines of this fight for privacy and freedom There have always been dark times in our history where America has strayed from the ideals that make us a great nation But the question has always been, can we overcome? And you have always been a group of Americans who have answered a resounding "yes" to that question
When political groups try to censor great works of literature, you're the ones putting Huck Finn and Catcher in the Rye back on the shelves, making sure that our right to free thought and free information is protected And ever since we've had to worry about our own government looking over our shoulders in the library, you've been there to stand up and speak out on privacy issues You're full-time defenders of the most fundamental American liberties, and for that, you deserve America's deepest gratitude
You also deserve our protection That's why I've been working with Republicans and Democrats to make sure we have a Patriot Act that helps us track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties This is an issue that Washington always tries to make "either-or" Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles But this kind of choice asks too little of us and assumes too little about America We can harness new technologies and a new toughness to find terrorists before they strike while still protecting the very freedoms we're fighting for in the first place
I know that some of you here have been subject to FBI or other law enforcement orders asking for reading records And so I hope we can pass a provision like the House of Representatives did that would require federal agents to get these kinds of search warrants from a real judge in a real court, just like everyone else does In the Senate, the bipartisan bill that we're working on, known as the SAFE Act, will prevent the federal government from freely rifling through emails and library records without first obtaining such a warrant Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing; but doing it without the approval of our judicial system seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for
Now, in addition to the line about federal agents poking around in our libraries, there was also another line in the convention speech that received a lot of attention - a line I'd like to talk more about today At one point in the speech, I mentioned that the people I've met all across Illinois know that government can't solve all their problems They know that, quote, "parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white"
I included this line in the speech because I believe that we have a serious challenge to meet I believe that if we want to give our children the best possible chance in life; if we want to open doors of opportunity while they're young and teach them the skills they'll need to succeed later on, then one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens, as educators, and as parents is to ensure that every American child can read and read well
This isn't just another education debate where the answer lies somewhere between more money and less bureaucracy It's a responsibility that begins at home - one that we need to take on before our kids ever step foot in a classroom; one that we need to carry through well into their teenage years
That's because literacy is the most basic currency of the knowledge economy we're living in today Only a few generations ago, it was okay to enter the workforce as a high school dropout who could only read at a third-grade level Whether it was on a farm or in a factory, you could still hope to find a job that would allow you to pay the bills and raise your family
But that economy is long gone As revolutions in technology and communication began breaking down barriers between countries and connecting people all over the world, new jobs and industries that require more skill and knowledge have come to dominate the economy Whether it's software design or computer engineering or financial analysis, corporations can locate these jobs anywhere there's an internet connection And so as countries like China and India continue to modernize their economies and educate their children longer and better, the competition American workers face will grow more intense; the necessary skills more demanding
These new jobs are about what you know and how fast you can learn what you don't know They require innovative thinking, detailed comprehension, and superior communication
But before our children can even walk into an interview for one of these jobs; before they can ever fill out an application or earn the required college degree; they have to be able to pick up a book, read it, and understand it Nothing is more basic; no ability more fundamental
Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other learning possible, from complex word problems and the meaning of our history to scientific discovery and technological proficiency In a knowledge economy where this kind of learning is necessary for survival, how can we send our kids out into the world if they're only reading at a fourth grade level?
I don't know, but we do Day after day, year after year
Right now, one out of every five adults in the United States can't read a simple story to their child During the last twenty years or so, over ten million Americans reached the th grade without having learned to read at a basic level
But these literacy problems start far before high school In , only % of all fourth graders tested as reading proficient And the story gets worse when you take race and income into consideration Children from low-income families score  points below the average reading level, while students from wealthy families score fifteen points above the average And while only one in twelve white seventeen-year-olds has the ability to pick up the newspaper and understand the science section, for Hispanics the number jumps to one in fifty; for African Americans it's one in one hundred
In this new economy, teaching our kids just enough so that they can get through Dick and Jane isn't going to cut it Over the last ten years, the average literacy required for all American occupations is projected to rise by % It's not enough just to recognize the words on the page anymore - the kind of literacy necessary for st century employment requires detailed understanding and complex comprehension But too many kids simply aren't learning at that level
And yet, every year we pass more of these kids through school or watch as more dropout These kids who will pour through the Help Wanted section and cross off job and after job that requires skills they just don't have And others who will have to take that Help Wanted section, walk it over to someone else, and find the courage to ask, "Will you read this for me?"
We have to change our whole mindset in this country We're living in a st century knowledge economy, but our schools, our homes, and our culture are still based around th century expectations It might seem like we're doing kids a favor by teaching them just enough to count change and read a food label, but in this economy, it's doing them a huge disservice Instead, we need to start setting high standards and inspirational examples for our children to follow While there's plenty that can be done to improve our schools and reform education in America, this isn't just an issue where we can turn to the government and ask for help Reading has to begin at home
We know that children who start Kindergarten with an awareness of letters and basic language sounds become better readers and face fewer challenges in the years ahead We also know that the more reading material kids are exposed to at home, the better they score on reading tests throughout their lives So we need to make investments in family literacy programs and early childhood education so that kids aren't left behind before they even go to school And we need to get books in our kids' hands early and often
I know that this is often easier said than done Parents today still have the toughest job in the world - and no one ever thanks you enough for doing it You're working longer and harder than ever, juggling job and family responsibilities, and trying to be everywhere at once When you're home, you might try to get your kids to read, but you're competing with the other byproducts of the technological revolution: video games and DVDs that they just have to have; TVs in every room of the household Children eight to eighteen now spend three hours a day watching TV, while they only spend  minutes reading
Our kids aren't just seeing these temptations at home - they're everywhere Whether it's their friends or the people they see on TV or a general culture that glorifies anti-intellectualism, it's too easy for kids today to put down a book and turn their attention elsewhere And it's too easy for the rest of us to make excuses for it - pretending that putting a baby in front of a DVD is educational, letting a twelve-year-old skip reading as long as he's playing good video games, or substituting dinner in front of the TV for family conversation
We know that's not what our kids need We know that's not what's best for them And so as parents, we need to find the time and the energy to step in and find ways to help our kids love reading We can read to them, talk to them about what they're reading and make time for this by turning off the TV ourselves
Libraries can help parents with this Knowing the constraints we face from busy schedules and a TV culture, we need to think outside the box here - to dream big like we always have in America Right now, children come home from their first doctor's appointment with an extra bottle of formula But imagine if they came home with their first library card or their first copy of Goodnight Moon?
What if it was as easy to get a book as it is to rent a DVD or pick up McDonalds? What if instead of a toy in every Happy Meal, there was a book? What if there were portable libraries that rolled through parks and playgrounds like ice cream trucks? Or kiosks in stores where you could borrow books? What if during the summer, when kids often lose much of the reading progress they've made during the year, every child had a list of books they had to read and talk about and an invitation to a summer reading club at the local library?
Libraries have a special role to play in our knowledge economy Your institution has been and should be the place where parents and kids come to read together and learn together We should take our kids here more, and we should make sure politicians aren't closing libraries down because they had to spend a few extra bucks on tax cuts instead
Each of you has a role here too You can get more kids to walk through your doors by building on the ideas so many of you are already pursuing - book clubs and contests, homework help and advertising your services throughout the community In the years ahead, this is our challenge - and this must be our responsibility
As a librarian or as a parent, every one of you here today can probably remember the look on a child's face after finishing a first book They turn that last page and stare up at you with those wide eyes, and in that look you find such a sense of accomplishment and pride; of great potential and so much possibility
And in that moment, there's nothing we want more than to nurture that hope; to make all those possibilities and all those opportunities real for our children; to have the ability to answer the question, "What can I be when I grow up?" with "Anything you want - anything you can dream of"
It's a hope that's as old as the American story itself From the moment the first immigrants arrived on these shores, generations of parents have worked hard and sacrificed whatever is necessary so that their children could have the same chances they had; or the chances they never had Because while we could never ensure that our children would be rich or successful; while we could never be positive that they would do better than their parents, America is about making it possible to give them the chance To give every child the opportunity to try
Education is still the foundation of this opportunity And the most basic building block that holds that foundation together is still reading At the dawn of the st century, in a world where knowledge truly is power and literacy is the skill that unlocks the gates of opportunity and success, we all have a responsibility as parents and librarians, educators and citizens, to instill in our children a love of reading so that we can give them the chance to fulfill their dreams Thank you

On Monday, I traveled from DC to Chicago to witness a monumental event There were , people marching on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform in this country There were rallies all across the country but Chicago was one of the largest I had the opportunity to speak to the people who were gathering at Union Park before they marched over to Grant Park Four-hundred thousand people, mostly of Mexican origin, but large numbers of people from other countries - Nigerians and Pakistanis and Indians and Filipinos - people who've come to this country for the same reason that immigrants have been drawn to this country for generations: the notion that they can pursue and better life for themselves but, most importantly, for their children, if they work hard and apply themselves
I think most of you are familiar with the issues that have surrounded immigration They've gotten a lot of attention recently We have a system of legal immigration in which people are drawn through the normal processes and they apply for legal residency and ultimately get naturalized as citizens if they so choose The controversy right now surrounds undocumented workers - people who came here illegally, most of them crossing the border between Mexico and the United States It's estimated at this point that we probably have  to  million undocumented workers around the country Most of them are employed in low-wage backbreaking work in agricultural sectors, in packing plants, in restaurants, in construction Obviously, the country feels ambivalent about this influx
On the one hand, I think many of us  believe that these people are doing what any of us would do if we had an opportunity for a better life for our kids They take the risk of coming here; many of them are extraordinarily impoverished and would not likely be able to get to the United States through the limited number of visas that are currently issued
On the other hand, we are a nation of laws and these people did come here outside of the law Economists debate what kind of effect undocumented workers have in this country There's no doubt that in many areas, like the agricultural sector, these immigrants are doing work that Americans would not do, at least at the wages that are paid There are other circumstances in which it is clear that employers are importing these workers simply because they don't want to pay the living wages that Americans demand There is no doubt that if construction companies were willing to pay more that they would see more US workers applying for those jobs It does appear that undocumented workers have a somewhat adverse effect in depressing the wages of low-skill workers, which is why in the African-American community, for example, there is some nervousness of about the number of undocumented workers that are coming into this country and whether they are systematically replacing or pushing out low-skill, low-wage black workers
Having said all that, I think we need to recognize that if we are going to uphold the traditions of this country as a nation of immigrants, than we are going to have to deal with this issue in a way that reflects common sense and compassion
The House of Representatives passed a bill that was extraordinarily punitive It talked about border security and it made any undocumented worker in this country a felon; it also made people who potentially helped undocumented workers, for example, providing housing assistance or providing a domestic violence shelter potentially subject to a felony conviction
It's that draconian measure that passed in the House that prompted these marches, but what started as a march of fear on the part of many undocumented workers, I think, has become a march for hope People are hoping that they have an opportunity to legalize themselves in some fashion
In the United States Senate there has been a bipartisan group, including myself, Ted Kennedy, John McCain, Chuck Hagel, Mel Martinez, Ken Salazar, Lindsey Graham and a number of others who've been trying to negotiate a comprehensive package that would include stronger border security, making sure that employers actually verify employment status through a tamper-proof employee-verification card, and creation of a pathway to citizenship - earned citizenship - for the  to  million people that are already here The idea would be that those people, over the course of eleven years could earn their way to citizenship by paying a fine, paying their back taxes , staying out of trouble, learning English and so on The opponents of this kind of proposal call this amnesty and they hearken back to what happened in  when, in fact, undocumented workers were provided amnesty There was supposed to be a grand bargain where in exchange for such amnesty there was going to be serious border security and employer sanctions on those who had hired undocumented workers That never really happened And so people who are opposed to the Senate bill believe that the best strategy is not to provide amnesty to these undocumented workers but simply shut off the possibility that they can be hired, perhaps deport them where they can be rounded up and build either a virtual wall or a literal wall along the Mexican and United States borders That kind of approach just isn't realistic We're not going to deport  to  million people; many of them have been here for many years, many of them have strong roots, many of them have children who were born here and are therefore United States citizens It's hard to imagine that we want to live in a country where we would have police and immigration officials coming into people's homes and taking away the father of a family, sending him back to Mexico, leaving a mother and child behind
This is going to be an emotional issue It's not going to go away any time soon I think what we saw in those marches is the face of a new America America is changing and we can't be threatened by it We have to understand that we are going to be better off united than divided
When I spoke to folks at this rally I insisted that for those undocumented workers who hope some way to have a pathway to citizenship, they have to understand that citizenship involves a common language, a common faith in the country, common commitments and a common sense of purpose, fealty to a common flag I think there are times in these marches were you have seen Mexican flags; there has been controversy around a Spanish national anthem I think that is not helpful because it indicates that somehow the traditional pattern of immigrants assimilating to a broader American culture is not what these marchers are seeking I think they have to seek that because that is the essence of this country - that in diversity we come together as one
On the other hand, to those who are fearful of these immigrants, in some cases because they have come to represent a loss of control for the country and its borders, I would just say to them that we can't have a country in which you have a servant class that is picking our lettuce or plucking our chickens or looking after our children or mowing our lawns but who never have the full rights and obligations of citizenship That's just not the kind of country that I want to have my children grow up in and my hope is that over the coming months we can come up with the kind of comprehensive, thoughtful legislation that I think the Senate bill reflects and we can have strong border security, we can have employers do the right thing by hiring those who are here legally in some fashion, but that we also provide all those families, children, elderly people and teenagers that I saw in that amazing march on Monday the opportunity to be full members of the American community
Anyway, I will keep you guys posted on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you next week Bye-byeManassas, Prince William County, Virginia
November , 
:pm – Night Before the Election
What a scene What a crowd Thank you for Virginia 
Let me start by noting, Virginia that this is our last rally This is the last rally of a campaign that began nearly  years ago We've gone to every corner of this country, from here in Northern Virginia to the rocky coasts of Maine, to the open plains of Texas, to the open skies of Montana
I just want to say that whatever happens tomorrow, I have been deeply humbled by this journey You have welcomed Michelle and me and the girls into your homes You have shared your stories of struggle, you have spoken of your dreams, along the way, talking with all of you about your own lives
You have enriched my life, you have moved me again and again You have inspired me Sometimes when I have been down you have lifted me up You filled me with new hope for our future and you have reminded me about what makes America so special In the places I have gone and the people I have met, I have been struck again and again by the fundamental decency and generosity and dignity of men and women who work hard without complaint, to meet their responsibilities every day
I come away with an unyielding belief that if we only had a government as responsible as all of you, as compassionate as the American people, that there is no obstacle that we can't overcome There is no destiny that we cannot fulfill
Virginia, I have just one word for you, just one word Tomorrow Tomorrow After decades of broken politics in Washington,  years of failed policies from George Bush, twenty-one months of campaigning, we are less then one day away from bringing about change in America
Tomorrow you can turn the page on policies that put greed and irresponsibility before hard work and sacrifice Tomorrow you can choose policies that invest in our middle class, create new jobs and grow this economy so that everybody has a chance to succeed Not just the CEO but the secretary and the janitor; not just the factory owner but the men and women who work the factory floor Tomorrow you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that puts reason against reason, and city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need to hope
Tomorrow, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change that we need It starts here in Virginia It starts here in Manassas This is where change begins
Our campaign has not been perfect There are times when I look back and I've said, "you know I wouldn't have done that if I had thought about it a little bit more" But I'll tell you what When you think about this campaign we've got a lot to be proud of when it comes to the tone that we have set
We tried to argue issues and not engage in personal attacks We've been fierce in defending ourselves but we've tried to make sure that we are always reminding our supporters that all of us are in this together Black, white, Hispanic, native American, Asian, Democrats and Republicans, young and old, rich and poor, gay and straight, disabled and not disabled, all of us have something to contribute
We tried to communicate for these last two years that we can't afford the same political games, the same tactics that pit us against one another, that make us afraid of each other We can't afford that anymore Not this time Despite what our opponents might claim, there are no real or fake parts of Virginia anymore and then there are real or fake parts of America There is no city or town that is more pro-America than anywhere else We are all one nation All of us proud All of us patriots All of us salute this flag
The men and women who serve on our battlefields come from many walks of life, different political parties, but they fought together and they bled together Some die together under the same proud flag They have not served red America or blue America, they have served the United States of America And that is what this campaign has been about, we're calling us to serve the United States of America
In this campaign I have had the privilege to witness what is best in America, in the stories, in the faces, of men and women I have met at countless rallies, town hall meetings, VFW halls, living rooms, diners, all across America, men and women who shared with me their stories and spoke of their struggles but they also spoke of their hopes and dreams They want for their children a sense of obligation and debts to be paid to earlier generations
I met one of those women in Greenwood, South Carolina It was back early when we were way back in the polls Nobody gave us much of a chance back then I had gone to South Carolina early in the campaign to see what I could stir up in the way of endorsements, and I was at a legislative dinner sitting next to a state representative that I really wanted to endorse me So I turned to her and I said "I really want your endorsement" And she looked at me and she said "I'll tell you what, Obama, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina" I must have had a sip of wine or something that night because right away I said "Okay I'm coming"
So the next time I come to South Carolina it's about a month later We fly in about midnight We get to the hotel about one o'clock in the morning I'm exhausted I'm dragging my bags to my room when I get a tap on my shoulder and I look back and it is one of my staff people who says "Senator we need to be out of the hotel by  am" I say "Why is that?" He says "because we have to go to Greenwood, like you promised"
So the next morning I wake up and I feel terrible, and I think I am coming down with a cold, my back is sore, I feel worse than when I went to bed I open up the curtains in the hotel room to get some sunlight in and hopefully wake me up, but it's pouring down rain I go outside my room and get the New York Times, and there is a bad story about me in the New York Times I go downstairs after I pack, and my umbrella blows open and I get soaked, so by the time I get in the car I am mad, I am wet and I am sleepy
We drive, and we drive, and we drive It turns out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everywhere else Finally we get to Greenwood
First of all you do not know you're in Greenwood when you get to Greenwood, there aren't a lot of tall buildings in Greenwood We pull off to a small building — a little field house in a park — and we go inside, and low and behold, after an hour and a half drive, turns out there are  people there Twenty people They look all kind of damp and sleepy, maybe they aren't really excited to be there either
But I am a professional, I've got to do what I got to do I'm going around, I'm shaking hands, I am saying "How are you doing? What are you doing?"
As I go around the room suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me "fired up" I'm shocked I jumped up I don't know what is going on But everyone else acts as though this were normal and they say "fired up" Then I hear this voice say "ready to go" And the  people in the room act like this happens all the time and they say "ready to go"
I don't know what's going on so I looked behind me and there is this small woman, about  years old, a little over  feet, looks like she just came from church — she's got on a big church hat She's standing there, she looks at me and she smiles and she says "fired up"
It turns out that she was a city Councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective I'm not making this up And it turns out that she is famous for her chant She does this where ever she goes She says "fired up" and the people say "fired up", and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go"
For the next five minutes she proceeds to do this "Fired up?" and everyone says "fired up" and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go" I'm standing there and I'm thinking I'm being outflanked by this woman She's stealing my thunder I look at my staff and they shrugged their shoulders, they don't know how long this is going to go on
But here's the thing, Virginia After a minute or so I am feeling kind of fired up I'm feeling like I'm ready to go So I join in the chant It feels good For the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though it was still raining, even though I was still not getting big crowds anywhere, even though we hadn't gotten the endorsement from the people we were hoping for, somehow I felt a little lighter, a little better I'd see my staff and I would say "Are you fired up? and they would say "We are fired up, boss, are you ready to go?" And I'd say "I'm ready to go"
Here's my point, Virginia That's how this thing started It shows you what one voice can do That one voice can change a room And if a voice can change a room, it can change a city, and if it can change a city, it can change a state, and if it can change a state, it can change a nation, and if it can change a nation, it can change the world
Virginia, your voice can change the world tomorrow In  hours if you are willing to endure some rain, if you are willing to drag that person you know who is not going to vote, to the polls If you are willing to organize and volunteer in the offices, if you are willing to stand with me, if you are willing to fight with me, I know your voice will matter
So I have just one question for you Virginia, Are you fired up? Ready to go? Fired up Ready to go Fired up Ready to go Fired up Ready to go
Virginia, let's go change the world God bless you and God bless the United States of AmericaGrant Park, Illinois
If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer
It’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference
It’s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled – Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America
It’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day
It’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America
I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he’s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation’s promise in the months ahead
I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice President-elect of the United States, Joe Biden
I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation’s next First Lady, Michelle Obama Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the White House And while she’s no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure
To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics – you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you’ve sacrificed to get it done
But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to – it belongs to you
I was never the likeliest candidate for this office We didn’t start with much money or many endorsements Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington – it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston
It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth This is your victory I know you didn’t do this just to win an election and I know you didn’t do it for me You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime – two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they’ll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor’s bills, or save enough for college There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair
The road ahead will be long Our climb will be steep We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America – I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there I promise you – we as a people will get there
There will be setbacks and false starts There are many who won’t agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can’t solve every problem But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face I will listen to you, especially when we disagree And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it’s been done in America for two-hundred and twenty-one years – block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand
What began twenty-one months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night This victory alone is not the change we seek – it is only the chance for us to make that change And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were It cannot happen without you
So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers – in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people
Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House – a party founded on the values of self-reliance, individual liberty, and national unity Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, “We are not enemies, but friends…though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection” And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn – I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too
And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you To those who seek peace and security – we support you And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope
For that is the true genius of America – that America can change Our union can be perfected And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow
This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations But one that’s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta She’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing – Ann Nixon Cooper is  years old
She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two reasons – because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin
And tonight, I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America – the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can
At a time when women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot Yes we can
When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose Yes we can
When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved Yes we can
She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome” Yes we can
A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after  years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change Yes we can
America, we have come so far We have seen so much But there is so much more to do So tonight, let us ask ourselves – if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?
This is our chance to answer that call This is our moment This is our time – to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
Yes We Can Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America

To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States
Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night
To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you
Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
That's why I stand here tonight Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive
We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more
Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach
These challenges are not all of government's making But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush
America, we are better than these last eight years We are a better country than this
This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news
We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes
Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the st century, the American promise alive Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight On November th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough"
Now let there be no doubt The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners"
A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty These are not whiners They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint These are the Americans that I know
Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans I just think he doesn't know Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
It's not because John McCain doesn't care It's because John McCain doesn't get it
For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own Out of work? Tough luck No health care? The market will fix it Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots You're on your own
Well it's time for them to own their failure It's time for us to change America
You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma We measure progress in the  million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $, instead of down $, like it has under George Bush
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill
In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships
When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman She's the one who taught me about hard work She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life She poured everything she had into me And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine These are my heroes Theirs are the stories that shaped me And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States
What is that promise?
It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road
Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
Our government should work for us, not against us It should help us, not hurt us It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work
That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper
That's the promise we need to keep That's the change we need right now So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President
Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it
Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America
I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow
I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for % of all working families Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class
And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East
Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office
Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution Not even close
As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars And I'll invest  billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced
America, now is not the time for small plans
Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance I'll invest in early childhood education I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education
Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent
Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations
And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons
Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength" Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise
And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have
For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after , I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives
And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $ billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
That's not the judgment we need That won't keep America safe We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need
We are the party of Roosevelt We are the party of Kennedy So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy
As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future
These are the policies I will pursue And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism
The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook So let us agree that patriotism has no party I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America
So I've got news for you, John McCain We all put our country first
America, our work will not be easy The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose And that's what we have to restore
We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-s out of the hands of criminals I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values And that's to be expected Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
You make a big election about small things
And you know what - it's worked before Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know
I get it I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington
But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me It's been about you
For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington Change comes to Washington Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time
America, this is one of those moments
I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming Because I've seen it Because I've lived it I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands
And I've seen it in this campaign In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores
Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend
That promise is our greatest inheritance It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot
And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream
The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things They could've heard words of anger and discord They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked That together, our dreams can be one
"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried "And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead We cannot turn back"
America, we cannot turn back Not with so much work to be done Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend America, we cannot turn back We cannot walk alone At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess
Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America
I want to start by congratulating Senator Clinton on her victory tonight, and I want to thank the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who stood with our campaign today
There were a lot of folks who didn't think we could make this a close race when it started But we worked hard, and we traveled across the state to big cities and small towns, to factory floors and VFW halls And now, six weeks later, we closed the gap We rallied people of every age and race and background to our cause And whether they were inspired for the first time or for the first time in a long time, we registered a record number of voters who will lead our party to victory in November
These Americans cast their ballot for the same reason you came here tonight; for the same reason that millions of Americans have gone door-to-door and given whatever small amount they can to this campaign; for the same reason that we began this journey just a few hundred miles from here on a cold February morning in Springfield - because we believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics, and we know that this election is our chance to change it
After fourteen long months, it's easy to forget this from time to time - to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment It's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the tit-for-tat that consumes our politics; the bickering that none of us are immune to, and that trivializes the profound issues - two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril
But that kind of politics is not why we're here It's not why I'm here and it's not why you're here
We're here because of the more than one hundred workers in Logansport, Indiana who just found out that their company has decided to move its entire factory to Taiwan
We're here because of the young man I met in Youngsville, North Carolina who almost lost his home because he has three children with cystic fibrosis and couldn't pay their medical bills; who still doesn't have health insurance for himself or his wife and lives in fear that a single illness could cost them everything
We're here because there are families all across this country who are sitting around the kitchen table right now trying to figure out how to pay their insurance premiums, and their kids' tuition, and still make the mortgage so they're not the next ones in the neighborhood to put a For Sale sign in the front yard; who will lay awake tonight wondering if next week's paycheck will cover next month's bills
We're not here to talk about change for change's sake, but because our families, our communities, and our country desperately need it We're here because we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing for another four years We can't afford to play the same Washington games with the same Washington players and expect a different result Not this time Not now
We already know what we're getting from the other party's nominee John McCain has offered this country a lifetime of service, and we respect that, but what he's not offering is any meaningful change from the policies of George W Bush
John McCain believes that George Bush's Iraq policy is a success, so he's offering four more years of a war with no exit strategy; a war that's sending our troops on their third tour, and fourth tour, and fifth tour of duty; a war that's costing us billions of dollars a month and hasn't made us any safer
John McCain said that George Bush's economic policies have led to "great progress" over the last seven years, and so he's promising four more years of tax cuts for CEOs and corporations who didn't need them and weren't asking for them; tax cuts that he once voted against because he said they "offended his conscience"
Well they may have stopped offending John McCain's conscience somewhere along the road to the White House, but George Bush's economic policies still offend ours Because I don't think that the , Americans who've lost their jobs this year are seeing the great progress that John McCain has seen I don't think the millions of Americans losing their homes have seen that progress I don't think the families without health care and the workers without pensions have seen that progress And if we continue down the same reckless path, I don't think that future generations who'll be saddled with debt will see these as years of progress
We already know that John McCain offers more of the same The question is not whether the other party will bring about change in Washington - the question is, will we?
Because the truth is, the challenges we face are not just the fault of one man or one party How many years - how many decades - have we been talking about solving our health care crisis? How many Presidents have promised to end our dependence on foreign oil? How many jobs have gone overseas in the s, and the s, and the s? And we still haven't done anything about it And we know why
In every election, politicians come to your cities and your towns, and they tell you what you want to hear, and they make big promises, and they lay out all these plans and policies But then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over Lobbyists spend millions of dollars to get their way The status quo sets in And instead of fighting for health care or jobs, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week It happens year after year after year
Well this is your chance to say "Not this year" This is your chance to say "Not this time" We have a choice in this election
We can be a party that says there's no problem with taking money from Washington lobbyists - from oil lobbyists and drug lobbyists and insurance lobbyists We can pretend that they represent real Americans and look the other way when they use their money and influence to stop us from reforming health care or investing in renewable energy for yet another four years
Or this time, we can recognize that you can't be the champion of working Americans if you're funded by the lobbyists who drown out their voices We can do what we've done in this campaign, and say that we won't take a dime of their money We can do what I did in Illinois, and in Washington, and bring both parties together to rein in their power so we can take our government back It's our choice
We can be a party that thinks the only way to look tough on national security is to talk, and act, and vote like George Bush and John McCain We can use fear as a tactic, and the threat of terrorism to scare up votes
Or we can decide that real strength is asking the tough questions before we send our troops to fight We can see the threats we face for what they are - a call to rally all Americans and all the world against the common challenges of the st century - terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease That's what it takes to keep us safe in the world That's the real legacy of Roosevelt and Kennedy and Truman
We can be a party that says and does whatever it takes to win the next election We can calculate and poll-test our positions and tell everyone exactly what they want to hear
Or we can be the party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should We can tell everyone what they need to hear about the challenges we face We can seek to regain not just an office, but the trust of the American people that their leaders in Washington will tell them the truth That's the choice in this election
We can be a party of those who only think like we do and only agree with all our positions We can continue to slice and dice this country into Red States and Blue States We can exploit the divisions that exist in our country for pure political gain
Or this time, we can build on the movement we've started in this campaign - a movement that's united Democrats, Independents, and Republicans; a movement of young and old, rich and poor; white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American Because one thing I know from traveling to forty-six states this campaign season is that we're not as divided as our politics suggests We may have different stories and different backgrounds, but we hold common hopes for the future of this country
In the end, this election is still our best chance to solve the problems we've been talking about for decades - as one nation; as one people Fourteen months later, that is still what this election is about
Millions of Americans who believe we can do better - that we must do better - have put us in a position to bring about real change Now it's up to you, Indiana You can decide whether we're going to travel the same worn path, or whether we chart a new course that offers real hope for the future
During the course of this campaign, we've all learned what my wife reminds me of all the time - that I am not a perfect man And I will not be a perfect President And so while I will always listen to you, and be honest with you, and fight for you every single day for the next for years, I will also ask you to be a part of the change that we need Because in my two decades of public service to this country, I have seen time and time again that real change doesn't begin in the halls of Washington, but on the streets of America It doesn't happen from the top-down, it happens from the bottom-up
I also know that real change has never been easy, and it won't be easy this time either The status quo in Washington will fight harder than they ever have to divide us and distract us with ads and attacks from now until November
But don't ever forget that you have the power to change this country
You can make this election about how we're going to help those workers in Logansport; how we're going to re-train them, and educate them, and make our workforce competitive in a global economy
You can make this election about how we're going to make health care affordable for that family in North Carolina; how we're going to help those families sitting around the kitchen table tonight pay their bills and stay in their homes
You can make this election about how we plan to leave our children and all children a planet that's safer and a world that still sees America the same way my father saw it from across the ocean - as a beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for all mankind
It is now our turn to follow in the footsteps of all those generations who sacrificed and struggled and faced down the greatest odds to perfect our improbable union And if we're willing to do what they did; if we're willing to shed our cynicism and our doubts and our fears; if we're willing to believe in what's possible again; then I believe that we won't just win this primary election, we won't just win this election in November, we will change this country, and keep this country's promise alive in the twenty-first century Thank you, and may God Bless the United States of America

Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today
We all made this journey for a reason It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be In the face of war, you believe there can be peace In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union
That's the journey we're on today But let me tell you how I came to be here As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state I moved to Illinois over two decades ago I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $, a year And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America
My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill
It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith
After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator
It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today
It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed
It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America
And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States
I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change
The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call
For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it
That's what Abraham Lincoln understood He had his doubts He had his defeats He had his setbacks But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans
All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can We know the challenges We've heard them We've talked about them for years
What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems
For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants
And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back The time for that politics is over It's time to turn the page
We've made some progress already I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate
But Washington has a long way to go And it won't be easy That's why we'll have to set priorities We'll have to make hard choices And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice So let us begin Let us begin this hard work together Let us transform this nation
Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America
And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again
Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work Let's do this
Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term
Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here
Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe
But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq Most of you know I opposed this war from the start I thought it was a tragic mistake Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been America, it's time to start bringing our troops home It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of  Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace
Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love Let us be the generation that begins this work
I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things I understand the skepticism After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own
That is why this campaign can't only be about me It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
By ourselves, this change will not happen Divided, we are bound to fail
But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible
He tells us that there is power in words
He tells us that there is power in conviction
That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people
He tells us that there is power in hope
As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through"
That is our purpose here today
That's why I'm in this race
Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation
I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity
I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all
I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America
And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth

Mr President, I am proud to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior senator from West Virginia He's absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill We did that in the Patriot Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and didn't work during the previous  years We should do that again with this important piece of legislation
But I want to take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us
I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the campaigning will begin in earnest And there will be -second attack ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire
And yet, while I know all of this, I'm still disappointed Because what we're doing here today - a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused - should be bigger than politics This is serious
If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences - heartfelt convictions that couldn't be settled by compromise - I would understand But it's not
All of us - Democrats and Republicans - want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this And all of us were willing to do that in this bill Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people
In the five years that the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one terrorist has been tried Not one has been convicted And in the end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, which is why we're here today
We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay Easily This was not an either-or question
Instead of allowing this President - or any President - to decide what does and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered
Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused
And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus - the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one chance - one single chance - to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with
But politics won today Politics won The Administration got its vote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists
And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of  his day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists - people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives
And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I quote, "actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay"
And yet, we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool And we have recommendations from the bipartisan  commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact
The problem with this bill is not that it's too tough on terrorists The problem with this bill is that it's sloppy And the reason it's sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right
I've heard, for example, the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal judges, who should make decisions on these detainees I actually agree with that The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through Indeed, the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court
This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern He's absolutely right it should be our primary concern - which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation
Now, let me be clear - for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not And for those who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot
But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldn't have been there - as one US commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks" And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information
In the future, people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence They may remain locked away forever
And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary We could've drafted a bipartisan, well-structured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great
Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle - those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November th
That is not how we should be doing business in the US Senate, and that's not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war At bare minimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over Thank you
It has now been a little over two months since we began this campaign In that time we have traveled all across this country And before every event we do, I usually have a minute to sit quietly and collect my thoughts And recently, I’ve found myself reflecting on what it was that led me to public service in the first place
I live in Chicago now, but I am not a native of that great city I moved there when I was just a year out of college, and a group of churches offered me a job as a community organizer so I could help rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants
The salary was $, a year plus enough money to buy an old, beat-up car, and so I took the job and drove out to Chicago, where I didn’t know a soul And during the time I was there, we worked to set up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids
And it was the best education I ever had, because I learned in those neighborhoods that when ordinary people come together, they can achieve extraordinary things
After three years, I went back to law school I left there with a degree and a lifetime of debt, but I turned down the corporate job offers so I could come back to Chicago and organize a voter registration drive I also started a civil rights practice, and began to teach constitutional law
And after a few years, people started coming up to me and telling me I should run for state Senate So I did what every man does when he’s faced with a big decision – I prayed, and I asked my wife And after consulting those two higher powers, I decided to get in the race
And everywhere I’d go, I’d get two questions First, they’d ask, “Where’d you get that funny name, Barack Obama?” Because people just couldn’t pronounce it They’d call me “Alabama,” or they’d call me “Yo Mama” And I’d tell them that my father was from Kenya, and that’s where I got my name And my mother was from Kansas, and that’s where I got my accent from
And the second thing people would ask me was, “You seem like a nice young man You’ve done all this great work You’ve been a community organizer, and you teach law school, you’re a civil rights attorney, you’re a family man – why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?”
And I understand the question, and the cynicism We all understand it
We understand it because we get the sense today that politics has become a business and not a mission In the last several years, we have seen Washington become a place where keeping score of who’s up and who’s down is more important than who’s working on behalf of the American people
We have been told that our mounting debts don’t matter, that the economy is doing great, and so Americans should be left to face their anxiety about rising health care costs and disappearing pensions on their own
We’ve been told that climate change is a hoax, that our broken schools cannot be fixed, that we are destined to send millions of dollars a day to Mideast dictators for their oil And we’ve seen how a foreign policy based on bluster and bombast can lead us into a war that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged
And when we try to have an honest debate about the crises we face, whether it’s on the Senate floor or a Sunday talk show, the conversation isn’t about finding common ground, it’s about finding someone to blame We’re divided into Red States and Blue States, and told to always point the finger at somebody else – the other party, or gay people, or immigrants
For good reason, the rest of us have become cynical about what politics can achieve in this country, and as we’ve turned away in frustration, we know what’s filled the void The lobbyists and influence-peddlers with the cash and the connections – the ones who’ve turned government into a game only they can afford to play
They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we’re here to tell them it’s not for sale People tell me I haven’t spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington But I promise you this – I’ve been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change I’m running for President because the time for the can’t-do, won’t-do, won’t-even-try style of politics is over It’s time to turn the page There is an awakening taking place in America today From New Hampshire to California, from Texas to Iowa, we are seeing crowds we’ve never seen before; we’re seeing people showing up to the very first political event of their lives
They’re coming because they know we are at a crossroads right now Because we are facing a set of challenges we haven’t seen in a generation – and if we don’t meet those challenges, we could end up leaving our children a world that’s a little poorer and a little meaner than we found it
And so the American people are hungry for a different kind of politics – the kind of politics based on the ideals this country was founded upon The idea that we are all connected as one people That we all have a stake in one another
It’s what I learned as a state Senator in Illinois That you can turn the page on old debates; that it’s possible to compromise so long as you as you never compromise your principles; and that so long as we’re willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst
That’s how we were able to reform a death penalty system that sent  innocent people to death row That’s how we were able to give health insurance to , more children who needed it That’s how we gave $ million worth of tax cuts to working families in Illinois And that’s how we passed the first ethics reform in twenty-five years
We have seen too many campaigns where our problems are talked to death Where ten-point plans are crushed under the weight of the same old politics once the election’s over Where experience in Washington doesn’t always translate to results for the American people
And so if we do not change our politics – if we do not fundamentally change the way Washington works – then the problems we’ve been talking about for the last generation will be the same ones that haunt us for generations to come
We must find a way to come together in this country – to realize that the responsibility we have to one another as Americans is greater than the pursuit of any ideological agenda or corporate bottom line Democrats of California, it’s time to turn the page
It’s time to turn the page on health care – to bring together unions and businesses, Democrats and Republicans, and to let the insurance and drug companies know that while they get a seat at the table, they don’t get to buy every chair
When I am president, I will sign a universal health care law by the end of my first term My plan will cover the uninsured by letting people buy into the same kind of health care plan that members of Congress give themselves It will bring down costs by investing in information technology, and preventative care, and by stopping the drug companies from price-gouging when patients need their medicine
It will help business and families shoulder the burden of catastrophic care so that an illness doesn’t lead to a bankruptcy And it will save the average family a thousand dollars a year on their premiums We can do this
It’s time to turn the page on education – to move past the slow decay of indifference that says some schools can’t be fixed and some kids just can’t learn
As President, I will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country, because the most important part of any education is the person standing in the front of the classroom It’s time to treat teaching like the profession it is – paying teachers what they deserve and working with them – not against them – to develop the high standards we need We can do this
It’s time to turn the page on energy – to break the political stalemate that’s kept our fuel efficiency standards in the same place for twenty years; to tell the oil and auto industries that they must act, not only because their future’s at stake, but because the future of our country and our planet is at stake as well
As President, I will institute a cap-and-trade system that would dramatically reduce carbon emissions and auction off emissions credits that would generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy I’ll put in place a low-carbon fuel standard like you have here in California that will take  million cars’ worth of pollution off the road And I’d raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it’s time we did We can do this
We can do all of this But most of all, we have to turn the page on this disaster in Iraq and restore our standing in the world I am proud that I stood up in  and urged our leaders not to take us down this dangerous path And so many of you did the same, even when it wasn’t popular to do so
We knew back then this war was a mistake We knew back then that it was dangerous diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on September th We knew back then that we could find ourselves in an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
But the war went forward And now, we’ve seen those consequences and we mourn for the dead and wounded
I was in New Hampshire the other week when a woman told me that her nephew was leaving for Iraq And as she started telling me how much she’d miss him and how worried she was about him, she began to cry
And she said to me, “I can’t breathe I want to know, when am I going to be able to breathe again?”
It is time to let this woman know she can breathe again It is time to put an end this war
The majority of both houses of the American Congress – Republicans and Democrats – just passed a bill that would do exactly that It’s a bill similar to the plan I introduced in January that says there is no military solution to this civil war – that the last, best hope to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement is to let the Iraqi government know that America will not be there forever – to begin a phased withdrawal with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by March st, 
We are one signature away from ending this war If the President refuses to sign it, we will go back and find the sixteen votes we need to end this war without him We will turn up the pressure on all those Republican Congressmen and Senators who refuse to acknowledge the reality that the American people know so well, and we will get this done We will bring our troops home It’s time to turn the page
It’s time to show the world that America is still the last, best hope of Earth This President may occupy the White House, but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open It’s time to fill that role once more Whether it’s terrorism or climate change, global AIDS or the spread of weapons of mass destruction, America cannot meet the threats of this new century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America It’s time for us to lead
It’s time for us to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries That we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with We are not a country which preaches compassion to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city
That is not who we are
We are America We are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman, that lifted ourselves from the depths of Depression, that won Civil Rights, and Women’s Rights, and Voting Rights for all our people We are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity, and liberty, and hope on our doorstep That’s who we are
I was down in Selma, Alabama awhile back, and we were celebrating the nd anniversary of the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge It was a march of ordinary Americans – maids and cooks, preachers and Pullman porters who faced down fire hoses and dogs, tear gas and billy clubs when they tried to get to the other side But every time they were stopped, every time they were knocked down, they got back up, they came back, and they kept on marching And finally they crossed over It was called Bloody Sunday, and it was the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement
When I came back from that celebration, people would say, oh, what a wonderful celebration of African-American history that must have been And I would say, no, that wasn’t African-American history That was a celebration of American history – it’s our story
And it reminds us of a simple truth – a truth I learned all those years ago as an organizer in Chicago – a truth you carry by being here today – that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it
I am confident about my ability to lead this country But I also know that I can’t do it without you There will be times when I get tired, there will be times when I make a mistake – it’s true, talk to my wife, she’ll tell you But this campaign that we’re running has to be about your hopes, and your dreams, and what you will do Because there are few obstacles that can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change
That’s how change has always happened – not from the top-down, but from the bottom-up
And that’s exactly how you and I will change this country California, if you want a new kind of politics, it’s time to turn the page
If you want an end to the old divisions, and the stale debates, and the score-keeping and the name-calling, it’s time to turn the page
If you want health care for every American and a world-class education for all our children; if you want energy independence and an end to this war in Iraq; if you believe America is still that last, best hope of Earth, then it’s time to turn the page
It’s time to turn the page for hope It’s time to turn the page for justice It is time to turn the page and write the next chapter in the great American story Let’s begin the work Let’s do this together Let’s turn that page Thank you

Mr President, I would like to speak briefly on what is a roiling debate not only in the Senate but across the country, and that is the President's policy with respect to Iraq There are countless reasons the American people have lost confidence in the President's Iraq policy, but chief among them has been the administration's insistence on making promises and assurances about progress and victory that do not appear to be grounded in the reality of the facts We have been told we would be greeted as liberators We have been promised the insurgency was in its last throes We have been assured again and again that we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so we could stand down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming home We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, and we have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government  more months, and then  more months after that, and then  more months after that
Now, after the loss of more than , American lives, after spending almost $ billion, after Iraq has descended into civil war, we have been promised, once again, that the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will, this time, be well planned, well coordinated, and well supported by the Iraqi Government This time, we didn't have to wait to find out that none of this seems to be the case Already, American military officials have told the New York Times that there is no clear chain of command between Iraqis and US commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership Yesterday, Prime Minister al-Maliki, the person whom the President said had brought this plan to us, the man who is supposed to be our partner-in-chief for this new plan, told foreign journalists that if the United States would only give his Army better weapons and equipment, our soldiers could go home
The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, despite all evidence and military advice to the contrary, is the terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, open-ended authority to wage this war back in  Over  years later, we can't revisit that decision or reverse some of the tragic outcomes, but what we can do is make sure we provide the kind of oversight and constraints on the President this time that we failed to do the last time
I cannot in good conscience support this escalation It is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has failed Just this morning, I had veterans of the Iraq war visit my office to explain to me that this surge concept is, in fact, no different from what we have repeatedly tried, but with , troops, we will not in any imaginable way be able to accomplish any new progress
The fact is that we have tried this road before In the end, no amount of American forces can solve the political differences that lie at the heart of somebody else's civil war As the President's own military commanders have said, escalation only prevents the Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own future It is even eroding our efforts in the wider war on terror as some of the extra soldiers will come directly from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has become resurgent
The President has offered no evidence that more US troops will be able to pressure Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds toward the necessary political settlement, and he has attached no consequences to his plan should the Iraqis fail to make progress In fact, just last week, when I repeatedly asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqi Government failed to meet the benchmarks the President has called for and says are an integral part of their rationale for escalation, she couldn't give me an answer When I asked her if there were any circumstances whatsoever in which we would tell the Iraqis that their failure to make progress means the end of our military commitment, she could not give me an answer This is simply not good enough When you ask how many more months and how many more dollars and how many more lives it will take to end the policy that everyone now knows has not succeeded, ``I don't know'' isn't good enough
Over the past  years, we have given this administration every chance to get this right, and they have disappointed us many times But ultimately it is our brave men and women in uniform and their families who bear the greatest burden for these mistakes They have performed in an exemplary fashion At no stage have they faltered in the mission that has been presented to them
Unfortunately, the strategy, the tactics, and the mission itself have been flawed That is why Congress now has the duty to prevent even more mistakes and bring this war to a responsible end That is why I plan to introduce legislation which I believe will stop the escalation of this war by placing a cap on the number of soldiers in Iraq I wish to emphasize that I am not unique in taking this approach I know Senator Dodd has crafted similar legislation Senator Clinton, I believe, yesterday indicated she shared similar views The cap would not affect the money spent on the war or on our troops, but it would write into law that the number of US forces in Iraq should not exceed the number that were there on January , , the day the President announced his escalation policy
This measure would stop the escalation of the war in Iraq, but it is my belief that simply opposing the surge is not good enough If we truly believe the only solution in Iraq is a political one--and I fervently believe that--if we believe a phased redeployment of US forces in Iraq is the best--perhaps only--leverage we have to force a settlement between the country's warring factions, then we should act on that That is why the second part of my legislation is a plan for phased redeployment that I called for in a speech in Chicago  months ago It is a responsible plan that protects American troops without causing Iraq to suddenly descend into chaos The President must announce to the Iraqi people that within  to  months, under this plan, US policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in US forces The President should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates
Drawing down our troops in Iraq will put pressure on Iraqis to arrive at the political settlement that is needed and allow us to redeploy additional troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, as well as bring some back home The forces redeployed elsewhere in the region could then help to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, something that every international observer is beginning to worry about It will also reassure our allies in the Gulf It will allow our troops to strike directly at al-Qaida wherever it may exist and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region
My plan would couple this phased redeployment with an enhanced effort to train Iraqi security forces and would expand the number of our personnel--especially special forces--who are deployed with Iraqis as unit advisers and would finally link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward reducing sectarian violence and reaching a political settlement
One final aspect of this plan that I believe is critical is it would call for engagement by the United States in a regional conference with other countries that are involved in the Middle East--particularly our allies, but including Syria and Iran--to find a solution to the war in Iraq We have to realize that neither Iran nor Syria wants to see the security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region and within their own countries So as odious as the behavior of those regimes may be at times, it is important that we include them in a broader conversation about how we can stabilize Iraq
In closing, let me say this: I have been a consistent and strong opponent of this war I have also tried to act responsibly in that opposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we provide our troops, who perform valiantly, the support they need to complete their mission I have also stated publicly that I think we have both strategic interests and humanitarian responsibilities in ensuring that Iraq is as stable as possible under the circumstances
Finally, I said publicly that it is my preference not to micromanage the Commander-in-Chief in the prosecution of war Ultimately, I do not believe that is the ideal role for Congress to play But at a certain point, we have to draw a line At a certain point, the American people have to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this blind alley in perpetuity
When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience is over Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the President on another tried-and-failed policy, opposed by generals and experts, opposed by Democrats and Republicans, opposed by Americans and even the Iraqis themselves It is time to change our policy It is time to give Iraqis their country back, and it is time to refocus America's effort on the wider struggle against terror yet to be won

Good morning I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington
But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years
I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America
I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact As some of you know, during the  US Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes Mr Keyes is well-versed in the Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless
Indeed, Mr Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved"
Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama
Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it To them, Mr Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining And since at the time, I was up  points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice
But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God He claimed knowledge of certain truths
Mr Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination
Mr Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life
And so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?
Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates - namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the US Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois
But Mr Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs
Now, my dilemma was by no means unique In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics
For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't
Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design
Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal beliefs - constitutional principles tie our hands At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith
Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy
And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people  percent of us believe in God,  percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion,  percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution
This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega-churches In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause
Each day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds - dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough
They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness
And I speak with some experience on this matter I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself As a consequence, so did I
It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma
I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst
And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well -- that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone
And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn - not just to work with the church, but to be in the church
For one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world As a source of hope
And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship -- the grounding of faith in struggle -- that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today
Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts
You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away - because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey
It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany I didn't fall out in church The questions I had didn't magically disappear But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth
That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values
And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse
Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends
In other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway
More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms Some of the problem here is rhetorical - if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice
Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments of the Lord" Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children" Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny
Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems
After all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man
Solving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby - but I also believe that when a gang-banger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem There's a hole in that young man's heart - a hole that the government alone cannot fix
I believe in vigorous enforcement of our non-discrimination laws But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers They have more lawyers than us anyway
I think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished
But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy
I am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology - that can be dangerous Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap -- off rhythm -- to the choir We don't need that
In fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not They don't need to do that None of us need to do that
But what I am suggesting is this - secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King - indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history - were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause So to say that men and women should not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition
Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal
Some of this is already beginning to happen Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and TD Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality
And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate
Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping ex-offenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
So the question is, how do we build on these still-tentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration
While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do -- some truths they need to acknowledge
For one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want state-sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it
Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers
And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles Folks haven't been reading their bibles
This brings me to my second point Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all
Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise It's the art of the impossible If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing And if you doubt that, let me give you an example
We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded
Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion
But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason
Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion
This goes for both sides
Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages - the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity - are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life
The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics
But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation - context matters It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God" I didn't Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats And one can envision certain faith-based programs - targeting ex-offenders or substance abusers - that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems
So we all have some work to do here But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives
So let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my US Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:
"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you"
The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing" His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda
But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight "right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose" The doctor went on to write:
"I sense that you have a strong sense of justiceand I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reasonWhatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fair-mindedYou know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve othersI do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words"
Fair-minded words
So I looked at my website and found the offending words In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro-choice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v Wade
Re-reading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fair-minded words Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points
So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own - a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me
And that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come Thank you

I said that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless man, but that he posed no imminent and direct threat to the United States
I said that a war in Iraq would take our focus away from our efforts to defeat al-Qaeda
And, with a volatile mix of ethnic groups and a complicated history, I said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq would require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
In short, I felt the decision unfolding then to invade Iraq was being made without a clear rationale, based more on ideology and politics than fact and reason
It is with no great pleasure that I recall this now Too many young men and women have died Too many have been maimed Too many hearts have been broken I fervently wish I had been wrong about this war; that my concerns had been unfounded
America and the American people have paid a high price for the decision to invade Iraq and myriad mistakes that followed I believe that history will not judge the authors of this war kindly
For all these reasons, I would like nothing more than to support the Kerry Amendment; to bring our brave troops home on a date certain, and spare the American people more pain, suffering and sorrow
But having visited Iraq, I'm also acutely aware that a precipitous withdrawal of our troops, driven by Congressional edict rather than the realities on the ground, will not undo the mistakes made by this Administration It could compound them
It could compound them by plunging Iraq into an even deeper and, perhaps, irreparable crisis
We must exit Iraq, but not in a way that leaves behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism, chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide that could engulf large swaths of the Middle East and endanger America We have both moral and national security reasons to manage our exit in a responsible way
I share many of the goals set forth in the Kerry Amendment We should send a clear message to the Iraqis that we won't be there forever, and that by next year our primary role should be to conduct counter-insurgency actions, train Iraqi security forces, and provide needed logistical support
Moreover, I share the frustration with an Administration whose policies with respect to Iraq seem to simply repeat the simple-minded refrains of "we know best" and "stay the course" It's not acceptable to conduct a war where our goals and strategies drift aimlessly regardless of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where we end up with arbitrary, poll-driven troop reductions by the Administration - the worst of all possible outcomes
As one who strongly opposed the decision to go to war and who has met with servicemen and women injured in this conflict and seen the pain of the parents and loved ones of those who have died in Iraq, I would like nothing more than for our military involvement to end
But I do not believe that setting a date certain for the total withdrawal of US troops is the best approach to achieving, in a methodical and responsible way, the three basic goals that should drive our Iraq policy: that is,  stabilizing Iraq and giving the factions within Iraq the space they need to forge a political settlement;  containing and ultimately defeating the insurgency in Iraq; and  bringing our troops safely home
What is needed is a blueprint for an expeditious yet responsible exit from Iraq A hard and fast, arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers our commanders in the field, and our diplomats in the region, insufficient flexibility to implement that strategy
For example, let's say that a phased withdrawal results in fifty thousand troops in Iraq by July ,  If, at that point, our generals and the Iraqi government tell us that having those troops in Iraq for an additional three or six months would enhance stability and security in the region, this amendment would potentially prevent us from pursuing the optimal policy
It is for this reason that I cannot support the Kerry Amendment Instead, I am a cosponsor of the Levin amendment, which gives us the best opportunity to find this balance between our need to begin a phase-down and our need to help stabilize Iraq It tells the Iraqis that we won't be there forever so that they need to move forward on uniting and securing their country I agree with Senator Warner that the message should be "we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it" At the same time, the amendment also provides the Iraqis the time and the opportunity to accomplish this critical goal
Essential to a successful policy is the Administration listening to its generals and diplomats and members of Congress - especially those who disagree with their policies and believe it is time to start bringing our troops home
The overwhelming majority of the Senate is already on record voting for an amendment stating that calendar year  should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security, creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq The Levin Amendment builds on this approach
The White House should follow this principle as well Visiting Iraq for a few hours cannot resuscitate or justify a failed policy No amount of spin or photo opportunities can change the bottom line: this war has been poorly conceived and poorly managed by the White House, and that is why it has been so poorly received by the American people
And it's troubling to already see Karl Rove in New Hampshire, treating this as a political attack opportunity instead of a major national challenge around which to rally the country
There are no easy answers to this war I understand that many Americans want to see our troops come home The chaos, violence, and horrors in Iraq are gut-wrenching reminders of what our men and women in uniform, some just months out of high school, must confront on a daily basis They are doing this heroically, they are doing this selflessly, and more than , of them have now made the ultimate sacrifice for our country
Not one of us wants to see our servicemen and women in harm's way a day longer than they have to be And that's why we must find the most responsible way to bring them home as quickly as possible, while still leaving the foundation of a secure Iraq that will not endanger the free world

When Ryan was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement
Yet, his parents had hope Because when Ryan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells They found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition
They did In fact, they seem to have cured him
Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just like any other child - a miracle his family had once only dreamed of
Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and life-threatening diseases and health conditions
Each year, , Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease Over  million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function And there are far too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence
For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries
Until now
Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions
Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life-saving applications of adult stem cell research Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of the cancer This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday
Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may not be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells
Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source
These and other difficulties are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem cell research
Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization At this very moment, there are over , embryos being stored in over  facilities throughout the United States The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use and cord blood use
All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and heart damage
At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help those who have lost the ability to walk
For these reasons, I'm proud to be a long-term supporter of greater stem cell research While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Public Health
And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today This bill embodies the innovative thinking that we as a society demand and medical advancement requires By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scientific research also be subject to rigorous oversight
I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate But I also realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about cloning humans We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever - and we're talking about using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans
Democrats want this bill to pass Conservative, pro-life Republicans want this bill to pass By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass It is only the White House standing in the way of progress - standing in the way of so many potential cures
I would only ask that the President thinks about this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and his parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure - hoping that somewhere, a researcher or scientist will find the answer
There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cure, but they needed help - they needed funding to make their research possible
With a world war raging and the country still emerging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own
But that didn't happen Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine
Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today for Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow At the dawn of the st century, we should approach this research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history
I urge my colleagues to support this bill Thank you

Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ? making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals
This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism
And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of , and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ? diplomatic, economic, and military ? to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it
In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ? a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful
A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism
Neither turned out to be true And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over That policy-by-slogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country “Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ? the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ? a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain
, Americans have now died in this war Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ? in North Korea, in Iran, and in Afghanistan And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America
These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ? a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region
This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in  The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences
Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq
When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil At that point, seventy-five US Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that  be a year of significant transition in Iraq
What we have seen instead is a year of significant deterioration A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control
According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and , Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February , Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier The addition of , American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers
Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier In just the past three weeks, he has ? and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ? “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq”
This is now the reality of Iraq
Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war
But it will not be easy For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war There are no options that do not carry significant risks And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security
What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve The American people have been extraordinarily resolved They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ? money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ? and that strategy must change
It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ? dreams and hopes We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ? namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home
There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war
Let me underscore this point The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question They are doing so today They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace
I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end No more coddling, no more equivocation Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ? military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control
The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ? a phased redeployment of US troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months
When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of  Such a timetable may now need to begin in , but begin it must For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the US is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq
Let me be more specific The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in US forces He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ? but it should not depend on Iraqi approval
I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point US commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger
Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region
Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism
As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the US troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists
In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced US force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time But only if US commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region
The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? especially special forces ? who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers
An increase in the quality and quantity of US personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents
Let me emphasize one vital point ? any US strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that US forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing
Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government The security forces have to be far more inclusive ? standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder
The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement
So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $ billion dollars in Iraq But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country
This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war This means no more bloated no-bid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses
We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement
Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution
This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ? and within their own countries
And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution
Make no mistake ? if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us
This brings me to a set of broader points As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism
Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century
The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ? free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ? cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well
The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home
The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ? and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies
We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq
The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism But there are many others
The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way
There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people According to a Pew survey, % of Americans now agree with the statement that the US should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now  showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world
But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ? a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality
Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing
There have been too many speeches There have been too many excuses There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families
The time for waiting in Iraq is over It is time to change our policy It is time to give Iraqis their country back And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won Thank you

The first time I came to Kenya was in  I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month
My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap
But it was a magical trip To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left
And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him
I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles
I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation
And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well
In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds
But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIVAIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict
One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise In early 's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's
How can we explain this fact? Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches
So what explains this? I believe there a number of factors at work
Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife
Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than  years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development
Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand It never did, and it never will" As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors
As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent
But, Kenya must do its part It cannot wait for other nations to act first The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind
It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable One that serves its people and is free from corruption
There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability
And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy It is being threatened by corruption
Corruption is not a new problem It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections In just the last year, our own US Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain
But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve
I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, % of Kenyans still live in poverty And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this
It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms % of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort
Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIVAIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought
What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions
It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive
Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust
In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time
The good news is that there are already signs of progress here Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue
Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of  This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising
But elections are not enough In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people
Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels
And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start
We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials
Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place
Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor
An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups
Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses
The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be
By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives They fight the fight of our time
Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too
You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way
You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth
And you will determine the direction of this country in the st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together
This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today
I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see
As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country
I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime
As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future
In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can Thank you

Mr President, I am proud to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior senator from West Virginia He's absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill We did that in the Patriot Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and didn't work during the previous  years We should do that again with this important piece of legislation
But I want to take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us
I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the campaigning will begin in earnest And there will be -second attack ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire
And yet, while I know all of this, I'm still disappointed Because what we're doing here today - a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused - should be bigger than politics This is serious
If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences - heartfelt convictions that couldn't be settled by compromise - I would understand But it's not
All of us - Democrats and Republicans - want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this And all of us were willing to do that in this bill Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people
In the five years that the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one terrorist has been tried Not one has been convicted And in the end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, which is why we're here today
We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay Easily This was not an either-or question
Instead of allowing this President - or any President - to decide what does and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered
Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused
And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus - the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one chance - one single chance - to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with
But politics won today Politics won The Administration got its vote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists
And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of  his day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists - people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives
And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I quote, "actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay"
And yet, we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool And we have recommendations from the bipartisan  commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact
The problem with this bill is not that it's too tough on terrorists The problem with this bill is that it's sloppy And the reason it's sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right
I've heard, for example, the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal judges, who should make decisions on these detainees I actually agree with that The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through Indeed, the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court
This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern He's absolutely right it should be our primary concern - which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation
Now, let me be clear - for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not And for those who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot
But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldn't have been there - as one US commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks" And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information
In the future, people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence They may remain locked away forever
And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary We could've drafted a bipartisan, well-structured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great
Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle - those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November th
That is not how we should be doing business in the US Senate, and that's not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war At bare minimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over Thank youSuper Tuesday
Chicago, IL
February , 
Before I begin, I just want to send my condolences to the victims of the storms that hit Tennessee and Arkansas They are in our thoughts and in our prayers
Well, the polls are just closing in California and the votes are still being counted in cities and towns across the country But there is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know - our time has come, our movement is real, and change is coming to America
Only a few hundred miles from here, almost one year ago to the day, we stood on the steps of the Old State Capitol to reaffirm a truth that was spoken there so many generations ago - that a house divided cannot stand; that we are more than a collection of Red States and Blue States; we are, and always will be, the United States of America
What began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the corn fields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers; students and seniors stood up in numbers we've never seen They stood up to say that maybe this year, we don't have to settle for a politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems This time we can finally do something about health care we can't afford or mortgages we can't pay This time can be different
Their voices echoed from the hills of New Hampshire to the deserts of Nevada, where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe Washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists anymore They reached the coast of South Carolina when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender; that crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children; that we can come together and build an America that gives every child, everywhere the opportunity to live their dreams This time can be different
And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states North and South, East and West, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change A chorus that cannot be ignored That cannot be deterred This time can be different because this campaign for the presidency is different
It's different not because of me, but because of you Because you are tired of being disappointed and tired of being let down You're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to Washington Because the lobbyists just write another check Or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should Or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters
And while Washington is consumed with the same drama and division and distraction, another family puts up a For Sale sign in the front yard Another factory shuts its doors Another soldier waves goodbye as he leaves on another tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged It goes on and on and on
But in this election - at this moment - you are standing up all across this country to say, not this time Not this year The stakes are too high and the challenges too great to play the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expect a different result This time must be different
Now, this isn't about me and it's not about Senator Clinton As I've said before, she was a friend before this campaign and she'll be a friend after it's over I respect her as a colleague, and I congratulate her on her victories tonight
But this fall we owe the American people a real choice It's change versus more of the same It's the future versus the past
It's a choice between going into this election with Republicans and Independents already united against us, or going against their nominee with a campaign that has united Americans of all parties around a common purpose
It's a choice between having a debate with the other party about who has the most experience in Washington, or having one about who's most likely to change Washington Because that's a debate we can win
It's a choice between a candidate who's taken more money from Washington lobbyists than either Republican in this race, and a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their money because we've been funded by you
And if I am your nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the war in Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I support the Bush-Cheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like And he will not be able to say that I wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it's ok for America to use torture - because it is never ok That is the choice in this election
The Republicans running for President have already tied themselves to the past They speak of a hundred year war in Iraq and billions more on tax breaks for the wealthiest few who don't need them and didn't ask for them - tax breaks that mortgage our children's future on a mountain of debt at a time when there are families who can't pay their medical bills and students who can't pay their tuition
They are running on the politics of yesterday, and that is why our party must be the party of tomorrow And that is the party I will lead as President
I'll be the President who ends the tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it And struggling homeowners And seniors who should retire with dignity and respect
I'll be the President who finally brings Democrats and Republicans together to make health care affordable and available for every single American We will put a college education within reach of anyone who wants to go, and instead of just talking about how great our teachers are, we will reward them for their greatness, with more pay and better support And we will harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all
And when I am President, we will put an end to a politics that uses  as a way to scare up votes, and start seeing it as a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the twenty-first century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease
We can do this It will not be easy It will require struggle and sacrifice There will setbacks and we will make mistakes And that is why we need all the help we can get So tonight I want to speak directly to all those Americans who have yet to join this movement but still hunger for change - we need you We need you to stand with us, and work with us, and help us prove that together, ordinary people can still do extraordinary things
I am blessed to be standing in the city where my own extraordinary journey began A few miles from here, in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant, is where I learned what it takes to make change happen
I was a young organizer then, intent on fighting joblessness and poverty on the South Side, and I still remember one of the very first meetings I put together We had worked on it for days, but no one showed up Our volunteers felt so defeated, they wanted to quit And to be honest, so did I
But at that moment, I looked outside and saw some young boys tossing stones at a boarded-up apartment building across the street They were like boys in so many cities across the country - boys without prospects, without guidance, without hope And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question What will happen to those boys?" And the volunteers looked out that window, and they decided that night to keep going - to keep organizing, keep fighting for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care And so did I And slowly, but surely, in the weeks and months to come, the community began to change
You see, the challenges we face will not be solved with one meeting in one night Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time
We are the ones we've been waiting for We are the change that we seek We are the hope of those boys who have little; who've been told that they cannot have what they dream; that they cannot be what they imagine
Yes they can
We are the hope of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake with doubts that tell him he cannot give his children the same opportunities that someone gave him
Yes he can
We are the hope of the woman who hears that her city will not be rebuilt; that she cannot reclaim the life that was swept away in a terrible storm
Yes she can
We are the hope of the future; the answer to the cynics who tell us our house must stand divided; that we cannot come together; that we cannot remake this world as it should be
Because we know what we have seen and what we believe - that what began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored; that will not be deterred; that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation, repair this world, and make this time different than all the rest - Yes We Can

Good morning I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington
But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years
I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America
I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact As some of you know, during the  US Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes Mr Keyes is well-versed in the Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless
Indeed, Mr Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved"
Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama
Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it To them, Mr Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining And since at the time, I was up  points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice
But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God He claimed knowledge of certain truths
Mr Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination
Mr Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life
And so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?
Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates - namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the US Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois
But Mr Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs
Now, my dilemma was by no means unique In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics
For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't
Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design
Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal beliefs - constitutional principles tie our hands At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith
Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy
And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people  percent of us believe in God,  percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion,  percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution
This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega-churches In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause
Each day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds - dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough
They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness
And I speak with some experience on this matter I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself As a consequence, so did I
It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma
I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst
And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well -- that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone
And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn - not just to work with the church, but to be in the church
For one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world As a source of hope
And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship -- the grounding of faith in struggle -- that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today
Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts
You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away - because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey
It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany I didn't fall out in church The questions I had didn't magically disappear But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth
That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values
And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse
Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends
In other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway
More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms Some of the problem here is rhetorical - if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice
Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments of the Lord" Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children" Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny
Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems
After all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man
Solving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby - but I also believe that when a gang-banger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem There's a hole in that young man's heart - a hole that the government alone cannot fix
I believe in vigorous enforcement of our non-discrimination laws But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers They have more lawyers than us anyway
I think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished
But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy
I am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology - that can be dangerous Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap -- off rhythm -- to the choir We don't need that
In fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not They don't need to do that None of us need to do that
But what I am suggesting is this - secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King - indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history - were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause So to say that men and women should not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition
Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal
Some of this is already beginning to happen Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and TD Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality
And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate
Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping ex-offenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
So the question is, how do we build on these still-tentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration
While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do -- some truths they need to acknowledge
For one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want state-sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it
Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers
And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles Folks haven't been reading their bibles
This brings me to my second point Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all
Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise It's the art of the impossible If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing And if you doubt that, let me give you an example
We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded
Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion
But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason
Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion
This goes for both sides
Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages - the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity - are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life
The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics
But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation - context matters It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God" I didn't Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats And one can envision certain faith-based programs - targeting ex-offenders or substance abusers - that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems
So we all have some work to do here But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives
So let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my US Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:
"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you"
The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing" His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda
But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight "right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose" The doctor went on to write:
"I sense that you have a strong sense of justiceand I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reasonWhatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fair-mindedYou know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve othersI do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words"
Fair-minded words
So I looked at my website and found the offending words In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro-choice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v Wade
Re-reading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fair-minded words Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points
So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own - a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me
And that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come Thank you

Thank you Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America
My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history
It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change
These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how
I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife
And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen
I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama" And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya
And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man
You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives
So I understand the cynicism But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate
We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand
And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked
And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in  and was  years old
And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life
I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was
I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus
And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America
She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn"
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation
And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act
And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America
She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few
And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream
And I think that we face one of those moments today
In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government
The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers
No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil
The world has changed And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 
But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again
It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away
That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams
That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly , flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base
Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore
You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here Because I think we've all had enough Enough of the broken promises Enough of the failed leadership Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance
Four years after , I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders
I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the  million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills
I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country I've had enough of that
I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia
I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country
You know, we all remember that George Bush said in  campaign that he was against nation-building We just didn't know he was talking about this one
Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man I think he loves his country I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do
The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees
It's called the Ownership Society in Washington But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself
It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own
It's a bracing idea It's a tempting idea And it's the easiest thing in the world
But there's just one problem It doesn't work It ignores our history Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity
Americans know this We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to
But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own We know that there are some things we do better together
We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other
That's what America is
And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about
Because I think that this is our moment to lead
The time for our party's identity crisis is over Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves We know who we are And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough
So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training
Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford
Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes
Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win
And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot
If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears
Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership They are longing for direction And they want to believe again A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America
At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding
Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story And she began to cry When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing I did not need sewing either I knew how to sew My mother is a seamstress in a factory I'm trying to go to college I don't need to sew to go to college My mother sews I hoped for something else"
I hoped for something else
I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too
And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as -year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see? Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in? Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country? Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?
We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew
Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time
Our time to make a mark on history
Our time to write a new chapter in the American story
Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up
And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose
They can say that this was the time when America found its way
They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again

The topic today is net neutrality The internet today is an open platform where the demand for websites and services dictates success You've got barriers to entry that are low and equal for all comers And it's because the internet is a neutral platform that I can put on this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through some corporate media middleman I can say what I want without censorship I don't have to pay a special charge But the big telephone and cable companies want to change the internet as we know it They say they want to create high-speed lanes on the internet and strike exclusive contractual arrangements with internet content-providers for access to those high-speed lanes Those of us who can't pony up the cash for these high-speed connections will be relegated to the slow lanes
Allowing the Bells and cable companies to act as gatekeepers with control over internet access would make the internet like cable A producer-driven market with barriers to entry for website creators and preferential treatment for specific sites based not on merit, the number of hits, but on relationships with the corporate gatekeeper If there were four or more competitive providers of broadband service to every home, then cable and telephone companies would not be able to create a bidding war for access to the high-speed lanes But here's the problem More than  percent of households get their broadband services from either cable or a telephone company
So here's my view We can't have a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and that's why I'm supporting what is called net neutrality In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee reached different conclusions on network neutrality Judiciary Committee members voted to protect net neutrality and commerce voted with the Bells and cable That debate is going to hit the House floor this Friday In the Senate, Senators Snowe and Dorgan are leading the fight for net neutrality and I've joined in that effort Senator Inouye, the ranking Democrat of the Commerce Committee, has joined us in this effort as well and he's working with Senator Stevens to put strong network neutrality into any Senate bill that comes before us There is widespread support among consumer groups, leading academics and the most innovative internet companies, including Google and Yahoo, in favor of net neutrality And part of the reason for that is companies like Google and Yahoo might never have gotten started had they not been in a position to easily access the internet and do so on the same terms as the big corporate companies that were interested in making money on the internet
I know if you are listening to this podcast that you are going to take an intense interest in this issue as well Congress is going to need to hear your voice because the Bell and cable companies are going to be dedicating millions of dollars to defeating network neutrality So I'll keep you updated on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you guys again next week 

I come to the floor today to discuss the bipartisan employment verification system amendment that Senators Grassley, Kennedy, Kyl, and I have introduced
One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement, and this bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border security But that's not enough Real enforcement also means drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration And that can only happen if employers don't hire illegal workers Unfortunately, our current employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work
Overall, the number of workplace arrests of illegal immigrants fell from , in  to  in , even as illegal immigration grew during that time Moreover, between % to % of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce access to employment
When Congress last passed an immigration bill in , we didn't provide a meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to work Currently, employees can prove their legal status by showing a variety of documents, and employers are supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filling out an I- form for each employee As a result, the market for fraudulent documents -- fake Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates - has exploded
But, with more than  million employees in more than  million workplaces, and only about  Wage and Hour investigators, employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to maintain records, not a serious risk of penalties As a result, the number of "intent to fine" notices issued to employers for hiring undocumented workers dropped from  in  to just three in 
Understandably, employers cannot always detect forged documents And employers who reject workers with questionable documents risk an employment discrimination suit
That's why we need a better alternative We need an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the use of fraudulent documents, significantly reduce the employment of illegal workers, and give employers the confidence that their workforce is legal
When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration reform in April, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating a national employment eligibility verification system Senators Grassley, Kyl, and I all thought that was a good idea in theory, but we had concerns with the design of the system
Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification system be implemented nationally within  months
Senators Kennedy and I proposed that the system be phased in over five years but that it also include additional accuracy and privacy standards, as well as strict prohibitions on use of the system to discriminate against workers
For the past few weeks, our staffs have worked together in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns of both proposals into consideration I'm pleased that we've reached an agreement
Under our compromise amendment, all employers would have to participate  months after the Department of Homeland Security receives the appropriations needed to fund the system All new employees hired would have to be run through the system, and a series of privacy and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from errors in the system and breaches of private information
And to make sure that employers take the system seriously, we strengthen civil penalties for employers who hire unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal penalties for repeat violators
We've worked in a constructive, bipartisan manner to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough on illegal workers This is a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it

Today, we take up the valuable time of the US Senate with a proposed amendment to our Constitution that has absolutely no chance of passing
We do this, allegedly, in an attempt to uphold the institution of marriage in this country We do this despite the fact that for over two hundred years, Americans have been defining and defending marriage on the state and local level without any help from the US Constitution at all
And yet, we're here anyway because it's an election year - because the party in power has decided that the best way to get voters to the polls is not by talking about Iraq or health care or energy or education, but about a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage that they have no chance of passing
Now, I realize that for some Americans, this is an important issue And I should say that personally, I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman
But let's be honest That's not what this debate is about Not at this time
This debate is an attempt to break a consensus that is quietly being forged in this country It's a consensus between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, that it's time for new leadership in this country - leadership that will stop dividing us, stop disappointing us, and start addressing the problems facing most Americans
It's a consensus between a majority of Americans who say, "You know what, maybe some of us are comfortable with gay marriage right now and some of us are not But most of us do believe that gay couples should be able to visit each other in the hospital and share health care benefits; most of us do believe that they should be treated with dignity and have their privacy respected by the federal government"
And we all know that if this amendment were to pass, it would close the door on much of this - because we know that when similar amendments passed in places like Ohio and Michigan and Utah, domestic partnership benefits were taken away from gay couples
This is not what the majority of the American people want And this is not about trying to build consensus in this country; it's not about trying to bring people together
This is about winning an election That's why the issue was last raised in July of , and that's why we haven't heard about it again until now And while this is supposedly a measure that the other party raised to appeal to some of its core supporters, I don't know how happy I'd be if my party only talked about an issue I cared about right around election time - especially if they knew it had no chance of passing
I agree with most Americans, with Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President Cheney, with over , religious leaders of all different beliefs, that decisions about marriage, as they always have, should be left to the states
Today, we should take this amendment only for what it is - a political ploy designed to rally a few supporters and draw the country's attention away from this leadership's past failures and America's future challenges
There is plenty of work to be done in this country There are millions without health care and skyrocketing gas prices and children in crumbling schools and thousands of young Americans risking their lives in Iraq
So don't tell me that this is the best use of our time Don't tell me that this is what people want to see talked about on TV and in the newspapers all day We wonder why the American people have such a low opinion of Washington these days This is why
We are better than this And we certainly owe the American people more than this I know that this amendment will fail, and when it does, I hope we can start discussing issues and offering proposals that will actually improve the lives of most Americans

For more than two years now, we have been watching a rolling genocide take place in Darfur, western Sudan Many of you I'm sure are aware of the tragedy that has been unfolding there For those of you who are not, essentially what we have seen is a systematic targeting on the part of the Khartoum government and the Janjaweed Arab militia that have systematically uprooted, killed, murdered, pillaged, raped, Africans, driven them from their homes into enormous displaced-person camps Refugee camps, within Sudan It's estimated that at least , people have been killed It's known that at least  million people have been displaced The administration early on in this tragedy acknowledged that this was genocide that was taking place I think there has been broad recognition in the international community that the behavior of the Sudanese government has been scandalous The rationale that has provided from the Sudanese government for what has been taking place is that there is a battle going on between Sudanese government and rebels that operate within the area But, the real victims have not been rebel sympathizers, or the rebels themselves, they've been innocent men, women and children
For more than a year now, I've been working with other Senators to see what we can do to really push the Administration to take this as seriously as it warrants To the Administration's credit, the United States government has probably paid more attention to this issue than some of our European allies We have been a major contributor of aid to the region; we have helped to finance the African Union, to provide peace-keeping forces in the Darfur area So, in a lot of ways, the United States government has been much more on top of this than Europeans, Canadians, and others, who oftentimes accuse the Untied States of being indifferent to the problems of the third world On the other hand, what has been done is not enough The few thousand African Union troops who have been placed in Darfur are primarily providing witness to some of the atrocities that are taking place there, but they don't have clear rules of engagement, they are under-armed, under-trained, they don't really provide the sort of protective force that would be needed to not only ensure that existing villages aren't ravaged by the Janjaweeds, but more importantly, that the  million displaced people could actually safely start returning home
Recent reports indicate that in the past few weeks alone, more than , people have been displaced There are also indications that the Janjaweed, recognizing that the AU forces, the African Union forces, are not particularly effective, have started targeting them So there is a sense of deterioration in Darfur, the situation may be getting worse, rather than better And, what's most disturbing is that the United States government seems to be backing off a little bit, the commitment that it made to deal with the problem There was a quote from the under-secretary for African Affairs, Secretary Frasier, in which she indicated that, maybe this was not a genocide after all And, if that ends up being the United State's attitude, then we could see continuing problems of a scale that might eventually reach the same scale in which happened in Rwanda
So, here are a couple of things that we think need to happen Number one: we need a UN peace-keeping mission in Darfur There have been conversations; the UN Secretary General, Koffee Annan, the AU forces, and the Bush Administration have all acknowledged this There's got to be a sense of urgency in which the US diplomatic efforts are focused on getting this UN peace-keeping force up to about , troops, and placing them in Darfur as quickly as possible with a strong protection mandate, rather than a monitoring one In the mean time, it's going to take about year, at best, to get a UN peace-keeping force in place We're going to have to supply and rally, bridging money and forces for the AU throughout this year, because, since it's sort of in lame-duck status, the Janjaweed recognize that AU forces are not particularly effective, they may become more and more of a target We're going to have to provide this successor UN force with our own lift and logistic assets We're going to have to provide our military hardware, like transport and attack helicopters, and so forth And, we're going to have to really force other countries like Canada, Australia, some of the European countries that are not engaged in peace-keeping in other places, or at least are not immediately involved in major activity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, as we are, to deliver the troops that are needed
So, it is absolutely critical that we start focusing on this now The situation, as bad as it is, could deteriorate further This is something that is of interest, I think, to all of us, not just for humanitarian reasons, although when you read the accounts of women being raped when they are out collecting firewood, when you read just horrendous accounts of entire villages being decimated and children being murdered, that it just breaks your heart, and humanitarian concerns should be sufficient, but we also have a strong national security interest If you start seeing more and more failed states, more and more displaced persons, more and more refugees, all of that becomes a breeding ground for terrorist activity, it becomes a breeding ground for disease, and it creates refugees that put pressure on our own borders In an inner-connected world we can't insulate ourselves from these tragedies So, we're going to, over time, have to develop some strategy as the world's remaining super-power to address these issues, and Darfur is an important test case We've already failed one test in Rwanda, we shouldn't fail another
Anyway, if you are interested in the issues related to Darfur, you can always contact my office, or get on the website Your voice is obviously critical in this issue I appreciate you, as always listening in Thank you for downloading, and I will talk to you next week Bye bye

I want to start by thanking the Kaiser foundation for the work you've done not only on today's report, but on making these issues of media and family a part of the national conversation
This is a subject many of us come to not as politicians or policy makers, as but as parents most of all
Because it's one thing to discuss sex and violence on television within the larger context of the culture wars - as a values debate between First Amendment crusaders and those who believe government should decide what we can and cannot watch - but it's a another thing altogether to be faced with these issues while you're sitting in front of the TV with your child
I watch with my daughters, Sasha and Malia, and I can tell you that when we're in the middle of a family program and a commercial for Cialis comes on, it's more than troubling to find yourself wondering how you'll explain certain medical conditions that last longer than three hours to a four-year-old and a seven-year-old
From the time they're young, we try to instill in our children a sense of what's right and wrong; a sense of what's important, of what's worth striving for As best we can, we also try to shield them from the harsher elements of life, and introduce them to the realities of adulthood at the appropriate age
But the concern shared by so many parents today - a concern that frankly hasn't been taken seriously enough by some on the left - is that raising your children this way has become exceedingly difficult in a mass media culture that saturates our airwaves with a steady stream of sex, violence, and materialism
Revolutions in information and technology over the last few decades have caused this stream to grow exponentially, as we're bombarded at every turn with sounds and images from DVDs, iPods, video games, and websites that we can't always control
At the center of it all sits the television, which still consumes the vast majority of our media use - even more so for our children And as we're spending more free time immersed in this media culture, the amount of questionable content spilling across our screens is growing by the year
Still, it's important for us to realize that the real problem we're facing is not simply one of quantity, or even the existence of sex and violence in the media per se
After all, the adult content in Schindler's List is far different from the type on Desperate Housewives, and the violence in Saving Private Ryan is not the same as the kind our kids try to imitate in some of the most popular video games
Rather, as your study today demonstrates, the larger concern here is one of message; it's what the media is teaching our kids about what is ok and what is not; about how to treat others and how to treat themselves
It's a concern that mass media is contributing to an overall coarsening of our culture
That with all the time our children are spending in front of the television, with all the choices they have to see whatever they want whenever they want, the content of their viewing is not enriching their minds, but numbing them; not broadening intellectual curiosity or appreciation for the arts, but trivializing the important and desensitizing us to the tragic
It may seem to some that the effect on our children has been overstated But the studies coming in from the NIH and others show that the connection is real When children are exposed to sex without consequences, they're more likely to have it
When they are shown the risks and responsibilities that go along with sex, at least one major subgroup - African-American youth - are more likely to abstain Mindless violence and macho aggression on television begets the same behavior in our kids And when eighty percent of African-American teens in a city like Washington think that they'll be rich and over half think they'll be famous, it hurts to hear them say that the path to success lies with the hoop dreams and rap careers glorified on television
We don't teach our children that healthy relationships involve drunken, naked parties in a hot tub with strangers - but that's what they see when they turn on The Real World We don't teach them to express their anger by seeing how much blood they can draw with a round of ammo - but that's what they learn in the most popular video games And we don't teach our kids that the height of success is inheriting a family fortune to buy Gucci bags without ever working a serious day in your life - but that's how Paris Hilton gets by on The Simple Life You can say that kids know this isn't real, but when they're fed a steady diet of these depictions over and over again from the time they're very young, this behavior becomes acceptable - even normal
So what do we do about this? What do we do when bad television becomes the enemy of good parenting?
We start by turning off the TV altogether Our children now spend an average of three hours a day in front of the television - for African-American children, it's four hours Two out of every three households have the TV on during meals
This is too much - period And so I think it would help if parents start setting down stricter rules on how much TV their kids watch and limit their hours I know this is difficult At the end of a long day, when Michelle and I are tired, it's easy to just sit the kids in front of the television and relax
But I think that as parents, we have an obligation to our children to turn off the TV, pick up a book, and read to them more often
Beyond that, when our kids do watch television, we should be watching it with them - this means finding programming that everyone can watch as a family and being there to answer any questions it may raise with our kids
Now, at a time when both parents are more likely to work longer hours outside the home, this is a lot easier said than done We try to compete with these media messages, but it's nearly impossible to be there every moment our kids are watching television
And so there's a broader responsibility here
We know that with the pervasiveness of mass media today - the existence of so many means of communication that are so easily accessible all over the world - it's very difficult to regulate our way out of this problem And for those of us who value our First Amendment freedoms - who value artistic expression - we wouldn't want to
But that doesn't mean we have to accept this coarsening of our culture
Decades ago, when television was still in its infancy, we provided broadcasters free use of the public airwaves, which they were to operate as trustees for the public And just last week, the Senate voted to set a final date for the transition to digital television
Today, we need to make it clear that the free use of the public airwaves continues to come with certain specific obligations But we also need to make it clear that for both broadcasters and their competitors there are larger civic obligations to the American public Obligations to reflect not the basest elements of American culture, but the profound and the proud
Obligations to seek not just the quick buck or the bottom line, but healthy discussion and debate in the public square of the information age Obligations to our children; to our families
Today, we have far more choice in what we watch than we could have ever imagined - more channels and more programming As we move further into the digital age, the transformation of entertainment will be even more dramatic than the one from stage to screen
And yet, with all these new choices for consumers, there has been remarkably little done to give parents the tools and the information necessary to make their own informed choices about what their children are watching
This is what the industry must do today As we move towards a digital environment, there is a golden opportunity for them to do it on their own - to use the latest in technology to give parents more information and more choice
For example, this technology could make it possible for parents to create their own family tier just by programming their television to block certain channels, block certain genres of programming like dramas, or block television at certain times of the day There's no reason the industry can't make it as easy to find family-friendly television as it is to program TiVo
But if the industry fails to act - if it fails to give parents advanced controls and new choices - Congress will
I know that Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye are putting pressure on both broadcasters and cable companies to do a better job fighting indecency, and I'm fully behind their efforts to get the industry to change I also applaud their announcement that they will be convening a summit on these issues with the goal of achieving immediate, meaningful reforms
But I'd like to outline some additional reforms that I think can make a difference for parents today
First, parents should be able to get better information right away - by improving the voluntary rating system we currently have Right now, our television ratings involve nothing more than a tiny box containing some letters and numbers that flashes in the upper left-hand corner of the screen for a few seconds at the beginning of each program It's hard to understand and easy to miss Broadcasters must improve this system to include a full-screen, detailed rating that gives parents a more precise understanding of exactly what content will be shown in the program
They must also ensure that promos for horror movies and ads for the show Las Vegas aren't being shown in the middle of a cartoon or a family sitcom with a more restrictive rating
Beyond simply blocking out negative messages, however, we also know from Kaiser's studies that television has the power to promote positive messages that can influence behavior and raise awareness
Public service announcements have actually led to reductions in teen pregnancy, and we should all be proud of the media initiative undertaken by the Kaiser Foundation with Viacom, BET, UPN and other networks to eradicate ignorance about HIV and AIDS
There has been a long debate about what obligations broadcasters will have to the public in this new digital age The FCC took a first step in defining these obligations by requiring that broadcasters air children's educational programming on all their digital streams
As they continue this process, the FCC must make sure they spell out these obligations before the transition to digital programming is complete
When they do this, they need to make sure that broadcasters have a concrete obligation to provide public service announcements at times when people can actually see them, as well as better coverage of elections They should donate the public service time to a third-party like the Ad Council that works with reputable non-profits If they do not do this, Congress should
In addition, we should also fight to prevent any attempt to gut funding or support for the Public Broadcasting System - positive television with educational messages that generations of children have been raised on
Finally, there's current legislation out there that would promote further studies - like this one - which would study the effects of media on the health and development of our children This will provide parents with even more information, it's got bipartisan support in Congress, and I think it's a good idea to pursue
In Newton Minow's famous "Vast Wasteland" speech to the National Association of Television Broadcasters, he told them that,
"It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims - you must also serve the nation's needs"
Four decades later, we find ourselves immersed in a mass media culture that is at once more vast and more wasteful than ever before And so once again, we find ourselves asking those in charge to serve the needs of a nation that has a higher calling than simply peddling indecency and materialism for profit We don't have to accept what we see today as inevitable We can all work together to make media a place where big ideas and great debates are communicated We owe this much to ourselves, and we certainly owe it to our children Thank you

Good morning I want to start by thanking American University and the Committee for Economic Development for hosting this panel today It's an honor to be here and an honor to be among such great company
Over one hundred years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold of America, creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country
As factories multiplied and profits grew, the winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad tycoons and oil magnates In the cities, power was maintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses And in the state of New York, there existed a young governor who was determined to give government back to the people
In just his first year, he had already begun to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways He also signed a workers' compensation bill, and even fired the superintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be regulating
None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party boss, who finally plotted to get rid of the reform-minded governor by making sure he was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year
What no one could have expected is that soon after the election, when President William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the corrupt machine bosses and powerbrokers came true when that former governor became President of the United States and went on to bust trusts, break up monopolies, and return the government to its people
His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt He was a Republican And throughout his public life, he demonstrated a willingness to put party and politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an open, honest government that would fight for their interests and uphold their values
Today, we face a similar crisis of corruption And I believe that we deserve similar leadership from those in power as well
The American people are tired of a Washington that's only open to those with the most cash and the right connections They're tired of a political process where the vote you cast isn't as important as the favors you can do And they're tired of trusting us with their tax dollars when they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate giveaways
It's not that the games that are played in this town are new or surprising to the public People are not naive to the existence of corruption and they know it has worn the face of both Republicans and Democrats over the years
Moreover, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences politics is the original sin of everyone who's ever run for office - myself included In order to get elected, we need to raise vast sums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are disproportionately wealthy This is a problem that predates George Bush or Jack Abramoff, and I believe that a serious, bipartisan conversation about campaign finance reform is one that this town would do well to have in the months to come
Yet, while people are familiar with these problems and they encompass both parties, I do think it's fair to say that the scandals we've seen under the current White House and Congress - both legal and illegal - are far worse than most of us could have imagined
Think about it In the past several months, we've seen politicians resigning for taking millions of dollars in bribes We've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under federal investigation We've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double since George Bush came into office And of course, we've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his cronies
Now, there's an argument made that somehow this is a bipartisan scandal And the defense here is that everybody does it Well, not everybody does it And people shouldn't lump together those of us who have to raise funds to run campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who invite lobbyists in to write bad legislation Those aren't equivalent, and we're not being partisan by pointing that out
The fact is, since this Republican leadership has come to power, this kind of scandal has been the regular order of business in this town For years now, they have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with former leadership staffers to increase their power in Washington
And yet, what is truly offensive to the American people about all of this goes far beyond people like Jack Abramoff It's bigger than how much time he'll spend in jail or how many Republicans he'll turn in Bigger than the K Street project and golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers
What's truly offensive about these scandals is that they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans
Because when big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while Americans still struggle to fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes
When a Committee Chairman negotiates a Medicare bill at the same time he's negotiating for a job as the drug industry's lobbyist, it's hardly a surprise when that industry gets taxpayer-funded giveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from bargaining for better drug prices
When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, of course they'll spend your tax dollars with reckless abandon; of course they'll load up bills with pet projects and drive us into deficit with the hope that no one will notice
In , over $ billion was spent lobbying Congress That amounts to over $ million per Member of Congress $ million per member so that oil companies can still run our energy policy and pharmaceutical companies can still raise our drug prices and special interests can still waste our tax dollars on pet projects
How much do you think the American people were able to spend on their Senator or Representative last year? How much money could the folks who can't fill up their gas tanks spend? How much could the seniors forced to choose between their medications and their groceries spend?
Not $ million Not even close
This is the bigger story here, and this is why the recent scandals have shaken the American people's faith in a government that will look out for their interests and uphold their values
The well-connected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they paid for They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want But outside this city, the people who can't afford the high-priced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn? When will someone in Washington stand up for me?"
We need to answer that call because let's face it - for the last few years, the people running Washington simply haven't And while only some are to blame for the corruption that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it
Now, I've been asked by my caucus to take a role in lobbying reform - a role I'm proud to have As many of you know I'm from Chicago - a city that hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country But during my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twenty-five years I hope we can do something like that here
I realize there are many proposals floating around out there, and I also realize that our friends on the other side of the aisle have many of their own I think that's commendable In fact, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to get a solid bill passed
But this has to be a serious bill, and it has to go a long way toward correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years This is not a time for window-dressing or putting a band-aid on a problem just to score political points This is a time for real reform, and I think the Democrats' Honest Leadership and Open Government Act does this by including provisions that so far the Republican proposals do not
Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and the Administration tell us when they're negotiating for jobs with industries they're responsible for regulating That way we don't have people writing a drug bill during the day and meeting with pharmaceutical companies about their future salary at night
Real reform means giving the public access to now-secret conference committee meetings and posting all bills on the Internet  hours before they're voted on, so the public can scrutinize what's in them
Real reform means passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from lobbyists, not just the expensive ones If the we truly agree that having a lobbyist constantly pick up the tab for lunch can help influence legislation, then they'll have no problem changing their position so that the ban includes meals of any price
Real reform means ending the no-bid contracts for well-connected contributors that have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in both Iraq and the Gulf Coast And it means ending the practice of appointing your political buddies to positions they are wholly unqualified for It means no more Brownies
Finally, I think that real reform must include real oversight and accountability Our bill sets up an independent Office of Public Integrity to keep an eye on lobbyists and to make sure they comply with the rules
Now, personally, I think that there's an opportunity for us to go even further than some of the proposals that have come from both parties And that's why last week I introduced the CLEAN UP Act, which would build on the Democrats' reform bill by giving the American public a clearer view of what's going on here in Washington
See, one of the reasons why lobbyists like Abramoff and their allies in Congress have been able to manipulate the system is because most of their backroom deals are done in secret Just the other day, we heard that because of pressure from health care industry lobbyists, Republican negotiators met behind closed doors and changed a budget bill to provide a $ billion giveaway to HMOs -- $ billion that would come right out of the pockets of American taxpayers But of course, no one knew about the change until much later, and no lawmaker would admit to making it
This is an outrage, and my bill would change this by identifying secret provisions like these that weren't in the original bill, and it would let the public know who put them there, so that special interest giveaways couldn't be slipped in at the last minute My bill also would shine the spotlight on those pet projects that lawmakers sneak into every spending bill by requiring that they earmarks be posted on the internet  hours before they're voted on The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, recently endorsed this bill, and I hope that the Senate will take it up soon
Let me close with one final point Even if we pass a good bill and rid Washington of the Jack Abramoffs of the world, it's going to take much more than gift bans and lobbying reform to restore the public's faith in a government It will take not simply a change in laws, but a change in attitudes
To do this - to earn back that trust - to show people that we're working for them and looking out for their interests - we have to start acting like it
That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to start meeting with some of the  million Americans with no health care
Instead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified buddies, it's time to start finding good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans trying to raise a family
Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who wonder how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension will be around when they retire
All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their ballot But in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do
A century ago, that young, reform-minded governor of New York who later became our twenty-sixth President gave us words about our country everyone in this town would do well to listen to today Teddy Roosevelt said that,
"No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and basewe can afford to differ on the currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty There is a soul in the community, a soul in the nation, just exactly as their is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual hopelessly mars himself if he lets his conscience be dulled by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the nation will hopelessly blunt the popular conscience if it permits its public men continually to do acts which the nation in its heart of hearts knows are acts which cast discredit upon our whole public life"
I can only hope that in the weeks to come, the work we do here and in Congress will once again strengthen this nation's soul and bring credit back to our public life Thank you

I want to thank the many people inside and outside of Congress who worked so hard over the past year to get us here We owe a debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and Rep Mel Watt Without their work and dedication - and the support of voting rights advocates around the country - I doubt this bill would have come before us so soon
And I want to thank both chambers, and both sides of the aisle, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original Act  years ago At a time when Americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship we are seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the Act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together
Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since 
Look at registration numbers Only two years after passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled Soon after, not a single state covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less than half of its minority voting-age population
Look at the influence of African-American elected officials at all levels of government There are African-American members of Congress Since , our nation's top diplomat has been an African-American
In fact, most of America's elected African-American officials come from the states covered by Section  of the Voting Rights Act - states like Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Georgia
But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building, in my dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom And on March , , he led  peaceful protestors demanding the right to vote across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama
I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day Not only John Lewis and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers - a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom
And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage? When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gaswhen they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day - after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of themafter all that, they went back to march again
They marched again They crossed the bridge They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of  was signed into law And it was reauthorized in , , and 
Now, in , John Lewis, the physical scars from those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and he was joined last week by  of his House colleagues in voting for its passage
There are some who argue the Act is no longer needed, that the protections of Section 's "pre-clearance" requirement - a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote - are targeting the wrong states But the evidence refutes that notion Of the , objections issued by the Department of Justice since , % occurred since the last reauthorization in  So, despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist
Others have argued against renewing Section 's protection of language minorities Unfortunately, these arguments have been tied to the debate over immigration and muddle a non-controversial issue - protecting the right to vote - with one of today's most contentious debates
But let's remember: you can't request language assistance if you're not a voter, and you can't be a voter if you're not a citizen And while voters, as citizens, must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors
A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying: "Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process; they also feel they trust the process more when they understand it" These sentiments - connection to and trust in our democratic process - are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation
Our challenges don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act either We have to prevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again We've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible ex-felons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters about the time, location and rules of elections Unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at minorities, the disabled, low-income individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups
The Help America Vote Act was a big step in the right direction, but we need to do more We need to fully fund HAVA We need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and that the equipment works And we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day
We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of deplorable intimidation tactics when they do get to the polls In , Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps, and followed voters to their cars to record their license plate numbers
In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that they could not vote
In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the "Milwaukee Black Voters League" was circulated in predominantly African-American neighborhoods with the following message: "If you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election If you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you"
So, we have much more work to do This occasion is cause for celebration, but it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights As Congressman Lewis said last week: "It's clear that we have come a great distance, but we still have a great distance to go"
The memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights Act Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote, but the right to have their vote counted Those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill We must take advantage of this rare united front and continue the fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls for all Americans In other words, we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country
Two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr King told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members that they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice That's because of the work that each of us do to bend it towards justice It's because of people like John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand that we are the beneficiaries of that arc bending towards justice
That's why I stand here today I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice I hope we continue to see that spirit live on, not just during this debate, but throughout all our work here in the Senate Thank you

I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren
Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by AIDS, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do Their decision to devote their time, their money, and their purpose-driven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and AIDS The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease
One of those passionate individuals is the man we just heard from - my friend and colleague, Sam Brownback Now, Sam and I may not agree on every issue, but I could not be more impressed with his efforts on issues like AIDS, the crisis in the Congo, the genocide in Darfur and sexual trafficking - issues that touch some of the world's most vulnerable people I am proud to work with him on many of these issues, and I'm proud to be by his side today
I took my own trip to Africa a few months ago As I'm sure Rick and Kay would agree, it's an experience that stays with you for quite some time I visited an HIVAIDS hospital in South Africa that was filled to capacity with people who walked hours - even days - just for the chance to seek help I met courageous patients who refused to give up for themselves or their families And I came across AIDS activists who meet resistance from their own government but keep on fighting anyway
But of all that I heard, I encountered few stories as heartbreaking as the one recently told by Laurie Goering, a Chicago Tribune reporter based in Johannesburg who had covered our trip for her newspaper
Three years ago, Laurie hired a woman named Hlengiwe Leocardia Mchunu as her nanny Leo, as she is known, grew up as one of nine children in a small South African village All through her life, she worked hard to raise her two kids and save every last penny she earned, and by the time Leo was hired as Laurie's nanny, she had almost finished paying off the mortgage on her home She had even hoped to use the extra money from her new job to open a refuge for local children who had been orphaned by AIDS
Then one day, Leo received a phone call that her eldest brother had fallen ill At first he told everyone it was diabetes, but later, in the hospital, admitted to the family it was AIDS He died a few days later His wife succumbed to the disease as well And Leo took in their three children
Six months later, Leo got another phone call Her younger brother had also become sick with AIDS She cared for him and nursed him as she did her first brother, but he soon died as well
Leo's pregnant sister was next And then another brother And then another brother
She paid for their caskets and their funerals She took in their children and paid for their schooling She ran out of money, and she borrowed what she could She ran out again, and she borrowed even more
And still, the phone calls continued All across her tiny village, Leo watched more siblings and cousins and nieces and nephews test positive for HIV She saw neighbors lose their families She saw a grandmother house sixteen orphaned grandchildren under her roof And she saw some children go hungry because there was no one to care for them at all
You know, AIDS is a story often told by numbers  million infected with HIV Nearly  million this year alone  million orphans in Africa , deaths and , new infections every single day In some places, % of those with HIV do not know they have it And we just learned that AIDS is set to become the rd leading cause of death worldwide in the coming years
They are staggering, these numbers, and they help us understand the magnitude of this pandemic But when repeated by themselves, statistics can also numb - they can hide the individual stories and tragedies and hopes of the Leos who live the daily drama of this disease
On this World AIDS day, these are the stories that the world needs to hear They are the stories that touch our souls - and that call us to action
I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like if Leo's family was my own If I had to answer those phone calls - if I had to attend those funerals All I know is that no matter how or why my family became sick, I would be called to care for them and comfort them and do what I could to help find a cure I know every one of you would do the same if it were your family
Here's the thing - my faith tells me that Leo's family is my family
We are all sick because of AIDS - and we are all tested by this crisis It is a test not only of our willingness to respond, but of our ability to look past the artificial divisions and debates that have often shaped that response When you go to places like Africa and you see this problem up close, you realize that it's not a question of either treatment or prevention - or even what kind of prevention - it is all of the above It is not an issue of either science or values - it is both Yes, there must be more money spent on this disease But there must also be a change in hearts and minds; in cultures and attitudes Neither philanthropist nor scientist; neither government nor church, can solve this problem on their own - AIDS must be an all-hands-on-deck effort
Let's talk about what these efforts involve First, if we hope to win this fight, we must stop new infections - we must do what we can to prevent people from contracting HIV in the first place
Now, too often, the issue of prevention has been framed in eitheror terms For some, the only way to prevent the disease is for men and women to change their sexual behavior - in particular, to abstain from sexual activity outside of marriage For others, such a prescription is unrealistic; they argue that we need to provide people with the tools they need to protect themselves from the virus, regardless of their sexual practices - in particular, by increasing the use of condoms, as well as by developing new methods, like microbicides, that women can initiate themselves to prevent transmission during sex And in the debate surrounding how we should tackle the scourge of AIDS, we often see each side questioning the other's motives, and thereby impeding progress
For me, this is a false argument Let me say this - I don't think we can deny that there is a moral and spiritual component to prevention - that in too many places all over the world where AIDS is prevalent - including our own country, by the way - the relationship between men and women, between sexuality and spirituality, has broken down, and needs to be repaired
It was striking to see this as I traveled through South Africa and Kenya Again and again, I heard stories of men and women contracting HIV because sex was no longer part of a sacred covenant, but a mechanical physical act; because men had visited prostitutes and brought the disease home to their wives, or young girls had been subjected to rape and abuse
These are issues of prevention we cannot walk away from When a husband thinks it's acceptable to hide his infidelity from his wife, it's not only a sin, it's a potential death sentence And when rape is still seen as a woman's fault and a woman's shame, but promiscuity is a man's prerogative, it is a problem of the heart that no government can solve It is, however, a place where local ministries and churches like Saddleback can, and have, made a real difference - by providing people with a moral framework to make better choices
Having said that, I also believe that we cannot ignore that abstinence and fidelity may too often be the ideal and not the reality - that we are dealing with flesh and blood men and women and not abstractions - and that if condoms and potentially microbicides can prevent millions of deaths, they should be made more widely available I know that there are those who, out of sincere religious conviction, oppose such measures And with these folks, I must respectfully but unequivocally disagree I do not accept the notion that those who make mistakes in their lives should be given an effective death sentence Nor am I willing to stand by and allow those who are entirely innocent - wives who, because of the culture they live in, often have no power to refuse sex with their husbands, or children who are born with the infection as a consequence of their parent's behavior -suffer when condoms or other measures would have kept them from harm
Another area where we can make significant progress in prevention is by removing the stigma that goes along with getting tested for HIV-AIDS The idea that in some places, nine in ten people with HIV have no idea they're infected is more than frightening - it's a ticking time bomb waiting to go off
So we need to show people that just as there is no shame in going to the doctor for a blood test or a CAT scan or a mammogram, there is no shame in going for an HIV test Because while there was once a time when a positive result gave little hope, today the earlier you know, the faster you can get help My wife Michelle and I were able to take the test on our trip to Africa, after the Center for Disease Control informed us that by getting a simple  minute test, we may have encouraged as many as half-a-million Kenyans to get tested as well Rick Warren has also taken the test Sam Brownback and I took it today And I encourage others in public life to do the same We've got to spread the word to as many people as possible It's time for us to set an example for others to follow
Of course, even as we work diligently to slow the rate of new infection, we also have a responsibility to treat the  million people who are already living with HIV
In some ways, this should be the easy part Because we know what works We know how to save people's lives We know the medicine is out there and we know that wealthy countries can afford to do more
That's why it was so frustrating for me to go to South Africa, and see the pain, and see the suffering, and then hear that the country's Minister of Health had promoted the use of beet root, sweet potato, and lemon juice as the best way to cure HIV Thankfully, the South African government eventually repudiated this, but it's impossible to overestimate how important it is for political leaders like this to set a good example for their people
We should never forget that God granted us the power to reason so that we would do His work here on Earth - so that we would use science to cure disease, and heal the sick, and save lives And one of the miracles to come out of the AIDS pandemic is that scientists have discovered medicine that can give people with HIV a new chance at life
We are called to give them that chance We have made progress - in South Africa, treatment provided to pregnant women has drastically reduced the incidents of infants born with the infection But despite such progress, only one in every five people with HIV around the world is receiving antiretroviral drug treatment One in every five We must do better We should work with drug companies to reduce the costs of generic anti-retroviral drugs, and work with developing nations to help them build the health infrastructure that's necessary to get sick people treated - this means more money for hospitals and medical equipment, and more training for nurses and doctors
We need a renewed emphasis on nutrition Right now we're finding out that there are people who are on the drugs, who are getting treatment, who are still dying because they don't have any food to eat This is inexcusable - especially in countries that have sufficient food supplies So we must help get them that nutrition, and this is another place where religious organizations that have always provided food to the hungry can help a great deal
And even as we focus on the enormous crisis in Africa, we need to remember that the problem is not in Africa alone In the last few years, we have seen an alarming rise in infection rates in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean And on this World AIDS day, we cannot forget the crisis occurring in our own backyard Right here in the United States, AIDS is now the leading cause of death for African American women aged -, and we are also seeing many poorer and rural communities fail to get the resources they need to deal with their vulnerable populations - a problem that unfortunately some in Congress are trying to address by taking money away from larger cities that are still facing enormous problems of their own
Now let me say this - I think that President Bush and this past Congress should be applauded for the resources they have contributed to the fight against HIV and AIDS Through our country's emergency plan for AIDS relief, the United States will have contributed more than $ billion over five years to combat HIV-AIDS overseas And the Global Fund, with money from the United States and other countries, has done some heroic work to fight this disease As I traveled throughout Africa this summer, I was proud of the tangible impact that all this money was having, often through coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control, the State Department, foreign governments, and non-governmental organizations
So our first priority in Congress should be to reauthorize this program when it expires in  Our second priority should be to reassess what's worked and what hasn't so that we're not wasting one dollar that could be saving someone's life
But our third priority should be to actually boost our contribution to this effort With all that is left to be done in this struggle - with all the other areas of the world that need our help - it's time for us to add at least an additional $ billion a year in new money over the next five years to strengthen and expand the program to places like Southeast Asia, India, and Eastern Europe, where the pandemic will soon reach crisis proportions
Of course, given all the strains that have been placed on the US budget, and given the extraordinary needs that we face here at home, it may be hard to find the money But I believe we must try I believe it will prove to be a wise investment The list of reasons for us to care about AIDS is long In an interconnected, globalized world, the ability of pandemics to spread to other countries and continents has never been easier or faster than it is today There are also security implications, as countries whose populations and economies have been ravaged by AIDS become fertile breeding grounds for civil strife and even terror
But the reason for us to step up our efforts can't simply be instrumental There are more fundamental reasons to care Reasons related to our own humanity Reasons of the soul
Like no other illness, AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes - to empathize with the plight of our fellow man While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracted the disease through no fault of their own, it has too often been easy for some to point to the unfaithful husband or the promiscuous youth or the gay man and say "This is your fault You have sinned"
I don't think that's a satisfactory response My faith reminds me that we all are sinners
My faith also tells me that - as Pastor Rick has said - it is not a sin to be sick My Bible tells me that when God sent his only Son to Earth, it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary; to feed the hungry and clothe the naked; to befriend the outcast and redeem those who strayed from righteousness
Living His example is the hardest kind of faith - but it is surely the most rewarding It is a way of life that can not only light our way as people of faith, but guide us to a new and better politics as Americans
For in the end, we must realize that the AIDS orphan in Africa presents us with the same challenge as the gang member in South Central, or the Katrina victim in New Orleans, or the uninsured mother in North Dakota
We can turn away from these Americans, and blame their problems on themselves, and embrace a politics that's punitive and petty, divisive and small
Or we can embrace another tradition of politics - a tradition that has stretched from the days of our founding to the glory of the civil rights movement, a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another - and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart, and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it, then we might not solve every problem, but we can get something meaningful done for the people with whom we share this Earth
Let me close by returning to the story of Leo, that South African woman burdened by so much death and despair Sometime after the death of her fifth sibling, she decided that she wasn't just going to stand idly by She decided to call the town's first public meeting about the AIDS crisis - something that no one had even talked about, let alone met about  people showed up Some had walked for miles to get there, a few with their grandchildren on their back
One by one, they stood up and broke their silence, and they told their stories Stories of tragedy, and stories of hope And when they were done, Leo rose and said, "I don't know whether we will win this war, but I'm looking for people who will stand up and face the reality The time for sitting silently has come to an end"
Everything did not suddenly get better after that meeting, but some things did Despite all the children she had to raise and all the sick relatives she still had to care for, Leo still decided to open the AIDS orphanage she had dreamed about so long ago She began building a daycare center that would house one hundred orphans And she started plans on a youth center and a soup kitchen
I hear that part of the story and I think, if this woman who has so little, and has lost so much, can do so much good - if she can still make a way out of no way - then what are we waiting for?
Corinthians says that we are all of one spirit, and that "if one part suffers, every part suffers with it" But it also says, "if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it"
On this World AIDS day, it is the stories of overcoming, and not just illness, that the world needs to hear Yes, the stories of sadness call us to suffer with the sick But stories like Leo's also call us to honor her example, rejoice in the hope that it brings, and work to help her find that brighter future Thank you, and God Bless you

When Ryan was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement
Yet, his parents had hope Because when Ryan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells They found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition
They did In fact, they seem to have cured him
Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just like any other child - a miracle his family had once only dreamed of
Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and life-threatening diseases and health conditions
Each year, , Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease Over  million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function And there are far too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence
For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries
Until now
Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions
Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the life-saving applications of adult stem cell research Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of the cancer This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday
Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may not be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells
Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source
These and other difficulties are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem cell research
Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization At this very moment, there are over , embryos being stored in over  facilities throughout the United States The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use and cord blood use
All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and heart damage
At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help those who have lost the ability to walk
For these reasons, I'm proud to be a long-term supporter of greater stem cell research While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Public Health
And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today This bill embodies the innovative thinking that we as a society demand and medical advancement requires By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scientific research also be subject to rigorous oversight
I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate But I also realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about cloning humans We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever - and we're talking about using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans
Democrats want this bill to pass Conservative, pro-life Republicans want this bill to pass By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass It is only the White House standing in the way of progress - standing in the way of so many potential cures
I would only ask that the President thinks about this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and his parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure - hoping that somewhere, a researcher or scientist will find the answer
There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands - especially children - disabled for life The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cure, but they needed help - they needed funding to make their research possible
With a world war raging and the country still emerging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own
But that didn't happen Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine
Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today for Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow At the dawn of the st century, we should approach this research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history
I urge my colleagues to support this bill Thank you
Well, good evening, everybody On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House Over the past eight years, this has always been one of our favorite nights And this year, I was especially looking forward to seeing how Joe Walsh cleans up -- pretty good
I want to begin by once again thanking everybody who makes this wonderful evening possible, including David Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center Trustees -- I’m getting a big echo back there -- and the Kennedy Center President, Deborah Rutter Give them a big round of applause
We have some outstanding members of Congress here tonight And we are honored also to have Vicki Kennedy and three of President Kennedy’s grandchildren with us here -– Rose, Tatiana, and Jack
So the arts have always been part of life at the White House, because the arts are always central to American life And that’s why, over the past eight years, Michelle and I have invited some of the best writers and musicians, actors, dancers to share their gifts with the American people, and to help tell the story of who we are, and to inspire what’s best in all of us Along the way, we’ve enjoyed some unbelievable performances -– this is one of the perks of the job that I will miss
Thanks to Michelle’s efforts, we’ve brought the arts to more young people -– from hosting workshops where they learn firsthand from accomplished artists, to bringing “Hamilton” to students who wouldn’t normally get a ticket to Broadway And on behalf of all of us, I want to say thanks to my wife for having done simply Yes And she’s always looked really good doing it She does
This is part of how we’ve tried to honor the legacy of President and Mrs Kennedy They understood just how vital art is to our democracy -- that we need song and cinema and paintings and performance to help us challenge our assumptions, to question the way things are, and maybe inspire us to think about how things might be The arts help us celebrate our triumphs, but also holds up a mirror to our flaws And all of that deepens our understanding of the human condition It helps us to see ourselves in each other It helps to bind us together as a people
As President Kennedy once said, “In serving his vision of the truth, the artist best serves his nation” Tonight, we honor five amazing artists who have dedicated their lives to telling their truth, and helping us to see our own
At eight years old, Mavis Staples climbed onto a chair in church, leaned into the microphone, raised her eyes upwards and belted out the gospel When people heard that deep, old soul coming out of that little girl, they wept -- which, understandably, concerned her But her mother told her, “Mavis, they’re happy Your singing makes them cry happy tears”
It was those early appearances on the South Side of Chicago -– South Side! -- with Mavis, her siblings, their father, Roebuck “Pops” Staples that launched the legendary Staple Singers Theirs was gospel with just a touch of country, a twist of the blues, little bit of funk There was a little bit of sin with the salvation And driven by Pops’ reverbed guitar, Mavis’ powerhouse vocals and the harmonies that only family can make, the Staple Singers broke new ground with songs like “Uncloudy Day” They had some truths to tell Inspired by Dr King, Pops would tell his kids, “If he can preach it, we can sing it” And so they wrote anthems like “Freedom Highway,” and “When Will We Be Paid” -- which became the soundtrack of the Civil Rights movement
As a solo artist, Mavis has done it all and worked with just about everybody from Bob Dylan to Prince to Jeff Tweedy On albums like “We’ll Never Turn Back,” and “One True Vine,” she still is singing for justice and equality, and influencing a new generation of musicians and fans And each soulful note -- even in heartbreak and even in despair -– is grounded in faith, and in hope, and the belief that there are better days yet to come “These aren't just songs I'm singing to be moving my lips,” she says “I mean this” And we mean it too Six decades on, nobody makes us feel “the weight” like Mavis Staples Give her a big round of applause
Al Pacino calls the theater his “flashlight” It’s how he finds himself, where he sees truth And since Al first hit Broadway in , his singular talent has been the gold standard for acting
A great playwright once compared the way Al inhabits his characters to the way Louis Armstrong played jazz One director said that while “some actors play characters, Al Pacino becomes them” And we’ve all seen it In the span of five years -- you think about it -- he became Serpico, became Sonny Wortzik, twice became Michael Corleone for, let’s face it, what have got to be the two best movies of all time, became Tony Montana on screen, then became the owner of a couple of Tonys on stage And he’s always been this way
At , Al committed so profoundly to a role in the school play that when his character was supposed to get sick on stage, Al actually got sick on stage I’m not sure how audiences felt about that Later, when he played Richard III and Jackie Kennedy visited him backstage, the actor playing the self-absorbed king didn’t even stand up to greet actual American royalty, which he says he still regrets
Through it all, Al has always cared more for his “flashlight” than the spotlight He says he’s still getting used to the idea of being an icon But his gift, for all the inspiration and intensity that he brings to his roles, is that he lets us into what his characters are feeling And for that, we are extraordinarily grateful Al Pacino
In the late sixties, James Taylor got the chance to audition in front of Paul McCartney and George Harrison Ringo, I don’t know if you were there -- but this is a true story “I was as nervous as a Chihuahua on methamphetamines" is what James Taylor says Which is exactly the kind of metaphor that makes him such a brilliant songwriter
But if James has a defining gift, it is empathy It’s why he’s been such a great friend to and Michelle and myself We're so grateful to him and Kim for their friendship over the years It’s why everybody from Carole King to Garth Brooks to Taylor Swift collaborates with him It’s what makes him among the most prolific and admired musicians of our time In fact, James recently went through all his songs and kept coming across the same stories -- songs about fathers and traffic jams; love songs, recovery songs I really love this phrase: “Hymns for agnostics” He says that in making music, “There’s the idea of comforting yourself There’s also the idea of taking something that’s untenable and internal and communicating it” And that's why it feels like James is singing only to you when he sings It feels like he's singing about your life The stories he tells and retells dwell on our most enduring and shared experiences “Carolina on My Mind” is about where you grew up, even if you didn’t grow up in Carolina “Mean Old Man” is probably somebody you know “Angels of Fenway” -- well, actually, that’s just about the Red Sox So if you're a White Sox fan you don’t love that song, but it's okay
James is the consummate truth-teller about a life that can leave us with more unresolved questions than satisfying answers, but holds so much beauty that you don’t mind And from his honesty about his own struggles with substance abuse to his decades of progressive activism, James Taylor has inspired people all over the world and helped America live up to our highest ideals Thank you, James Taylor
Without a preschool rivalry, we might not be honoring Martha Argerich The story goes that when Martha was two years old, a little boy taunted her, saying, “I bet you can’t play the piano!” So she sat down at the keys, remembered a piece her teacher had played, and played it flawlessly By eight years old, she had made her concert debut By the time she was a teenager, she left her native Argentina to study in Vienna and won two major international competitions, launching one of the most storied and influential careers in classical music That little boy lost his bet
Martha combines unparalleled technical prowess with passion and glittering musicianship From Bach to Schumann, she doesn’t just play the piano, she possesses it Martha can charge through a passage with astonishing power and speed and accuracy, and, in the same performance, uncover the delicate beauty in each note As a critic once wrote, “She is an unaffected interpreter whose native language is music”
But what truly sets her apart and has cemented her place as one of the greatest pianists in modern history is her dogged commitment to her craft In an age of often superficial connections, where people too often seek fame and recognition, Martha has been guided by one passion, and that is fidelity to the music She can only be herself And that is the truest mark of an artist And the result is timeless, transcendent music for which we thank Martha Argerich
And finally, there have been some interesting things said about this next group, including being called "one of rock's most contentiously dysfunctional families" So, yeah, it was unlikely that they'd ever get back together and that they called their reunion tour "Hell Freezes Over" I love that But here's the thing -- when you listen to the Eagles, you hear the exact opposite story, and that is perfect harmony
You hear it in the crisp, overpowering a capella chords of "Seven Bridges Road"; dueling guitar solos in "Hotel California"; complex, funky riffs opening "Life in the Fast Lane" It's the sound not just of a California band, but one of America's signature bands -- a supergroup whose greatest hits sold more copies in the United States than any other record in the th century And the th Century had some pretty good music
So, here tonight, we have three of the Eagles: Don Henley, the meticulous, introspective songwriter with an unmistakable voice that soars above his drum set Timothy Schmit, the bass player and topline of many of those harmonies And Joe Walsh, who’s as rowdy with a guitar lick as I’m told he once was in a hotel room Twice This is the White House, though And Michelle and I are about to leave As I've said before, we want to get our security deposit back
But, of course, the Eagles are also the one and only Glenn Frey And we all wish Glenn was still here with us We are deeply honored to be joined by his beautiful wife, Cindy, and their gorgeous children Because the truth is that these awards aren't just about this reception or even the show we have this evening, which will be spectacular The Kennedy Center Honors are about folks who spent their lives calling on us to think a little harder, and feel a little deeper, and express ourselves a little more bravely, and maybe “take it easy” once in a while And that is Glenn Frey -- the driving force behind a band that owned a decade, and did not stop there We are all familiar with his legacy And the music of the Eagles will always be woven into the fabric of our nation
So we are extraordinarily honored to be able to give thanks for the Eagles And what's true for them is true for all of tonight’s honorees: remarkable individuals who have created the soundtrack to our own lives -- on road trips, in jukebox diners; folks who have mesmerized us on a Saturday night out at the movies or at a concert hall
Mavis Staples Al Pacino James Taylor Martha Argerich The Eagles Their legacies are measured not just in works of art, but the lives they've touched, and creating a stronger and more beautiful America They’re artists who have served our nation by serving their truth And we’re all better off for it
So before we transport ourselves to what I'm sure will be a spectacular evening, please join me in saluting our extraordinary  Kennedy Center Honorees

Good evening, everybody Let me begin by thanking President Kuczynski and the wonderful people of Peru for hosting us and for their outstanding hospitality Peru is one of the United States’ strongest partners in the Americas -- from standing up for democracy, to promoting jobs and growth, to fighting climate change And this summit has been a success thanks to the great work of our Peruvian friends So on behalf of us all, muchas gracias
This summit, and my trip over the past week, has obviously occurred against a backdrop of the broader debate over globalization and trade As I’ve said, over the decades, our global, integrated economy has helped to improve the lives of billions of people around the world with historic gains in prosperity, education, and health At the same time, when jobs and capital can move across borders, when workers have less leverage, when wealthy corporations and global elites too often seem to be playing by a different set of rules, then workers and communities can be hit especially hard; the gaps between the rich and everyone else grow wider And that can reverberate through our politics
That’s why I firmly believe that one of our greatest challenges in the years ahead -- across our nations and within them -- will be to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are shared by more people and that the negative impacts, such as economic inequalities, are addressed by all nations When it comes to trade, I believe that the answer is not to pull back or try to erect barriers to trade Given our integrated economies and global supply chains, that would hurt us all But rather the answer is to do trade right, making sure that it has strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, that it addresses ways in which workers and ordinary people can benefit rather than be harmed by global trade All of this is the central work of APEC
As this debate moves forward in the United States, it’s important to remember how vital the Asia Pacific is to America’s prosperity The  Asia Pacific economies here represent nearly three billion people, a majority of the global middle class, six of America’s top  trading partners, more than half of the global economy, and the world’s fastest-growing region In other words, these  countries represent tremendous opportunity for the United States to sell our goods and support US jobs And that’s why, as part of the rebalance of our foreign policy to the Asia Pacific, we’ve boosted US exports to the region by some  percent Nearly  percent of our exports go to the region
And this is part of broader progress With  percent of the world’s customers beyond America’s borders, I’ve made it a priority to open up new markets overseas And during my Administration, we’ve increased US exports to the world by more than  percent -- to record levels -- and these exports support more than  million American jobs Moreover, we know that companies that export tend to grow faster and hire more employees and pay their workers more than companies that do not export All of which is why exports have helped to drive our economic recovery It's one of the reasons that US businesses have created more than  million new jobs
So that’s the kind of progress that trade -- when done right -- can deliver And that’s the kind of work that we’ve tried to do here at this summit We’re continuing our work to make it easier to do business between our countries so we’re creating even more jobs In the United States, we’re simplifying the process of starting a new business, increasing access to credit, all of which will help more ventures -- especially small businesses -- get up and running, and helping them to be able to export as well, so that they can access a global market even if they can't afford fancy lawyers and accountants and foreign offices
We agreed to increase our collective effort against corruption by targeting the bribery that enriches elites at the expense of people And we committed to making it easier to trade in services as well as goods
We also discussed the excess capacity that exists in certain sectors, like steel and aluminum that distorts markets and hurts business and workers, including American workers And even as I've argued that we cannot engage in protectionist measures, my Administration has been at the forefront of really cracking down hard on unfair trade practices and brought, consistently, cases against the -- cases under the WTO against those who are engaging in unfair trading practices, and we've had a great track record of trade enforcement that has to be a part of this process
I’ve been very clear that excess capacity is not the result of market forces; it’s the result of specific government policies, and it needs to be fixed And here at APEC, we've been taking steps, as we were at the G in Hangzhou, to start addressing these issues in a systematic way
With regard to the digital economy, we endorsed rules to protect the privacy of personal information as it crosses borders We discussed the importance of maintaining the current moratorium on customs duties for digital goods and innovation And given growing cyber threats, our  APEC economies affirmed that no one should conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, with the intent to providing a competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors
We’re also moving ahead with making our economies more inclusive And one particular area of focus is making sure that women have fair access to economic growth -- expanding education; expanding access to careers in science, technology, engineering and math; helping more women entrepreneurs to access finance and integrate their businesses into the global supply chain According to one study, if women around the world participated in the labor force, it could add up to $ trillion of additional output for the global economy -- $ trillion When women are more prosperous, then families, communities and countries are all more prosperous as well
My meeting yesterday with my fellow leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the TPP, with its high standards, strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property and human rights Our partners made very clear during the meeting that they want to move forward with TPP; preferably, they’d like to move forward with the United States A number of countries already are starting to ratify TPP
At the same time, we’re already hearing calls for a less ambitious trade agreement in the region with lower standards, lower protections for workers, lower protections for the environment That kind of agreement would obviously exclude US workers and businesses and access to those markets So for all those reasons, I believe that TPP is a plus for America’s economy, America’s workers, American jobs I think not moving forward would undermine our position across the region and our ability to shape the rules of global trade in a way that reflects our interests and our values
Finally, our cooperation with APEC has been critical to our historic progress in fighting climate change -- bringing the Paris agreement into force, agreeing to limit aviation emissions, phrasing out dangerous HFCs Here in Lima, we continue our work to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and countries made new commitments toward our goal of doubling our renewable energy over the next two decades
So, as I wrap up my last summit and likely my last foreign trip as President, I could not be more proud of the progress that we’ve made together Obviously, the work is never done And given the prosperity and security we seek for not only the United States but our allies and our partners, I continue to believe that America will have a vital role to play in creating and sustaining a strong, enduring leadership role in the Asia Pacific
So, with that, let me take some questions And I'll start with Darlene Superville of AP
Question: Thank you, Mr President You’ve been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he’s chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia’s alleged meddling in the US election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year’s campaign will be the new normal going forward in future US elections?
President Obama: Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign
My simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy
I can't be sure of anything I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world
And I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues That's just the way this office works
And I've said before, if these issues were easy -- if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries -- if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President And I'm a pretty good presidential historian; I've looked at my  predecessors, and it seems like for all of them -- even the best ones -- that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate I think the same will happen here And that's a good thing That's an important thing
With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting We talked briefly while we were in between sessions And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo, and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian ceasefire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort
And I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with Frances, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy
The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyberattacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack
I don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources -- domestic, foreign, on social media -- that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not And let me put it this way I think if we have a strong, accurate and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much
If, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside; the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside The good news is that's something that we have control over
Gardiner Harris
Question: Mr President, thanks so much for holding this press conference If you had had hotels, real estate, and other businesses distributed around the world prior to becoming President, would you have thought it appropriate to sell them off and put the cash proceeds in a blind trust? Or is it okay for the President of the United States to be personally vulnerable to the policy decisions of the foreign leaders he meets and in the foreign policy decisions he makes as President? And also, just briefly, what's your complaint about how the NSA and Cyber Command have done their job? And are you considering firing Admiral Mike Rogers?
President Obama: That was a rhetorical question, that first one Rather than comment on hypotheticals, let me say specifically what I did Obviously, my assets were significantly smaller than some other Presidents or President-elects But we made a decision to liquidate assets that might raise questions about how it would influence policy
I basically had our accountant put all our money in Treasury bills -- the yields, by the way, have not been massive over the course of the last eight years -- just because it simplified my life I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me
And that's consistent with the broader approach that we've taken throughout my Administration, which is to not just meet the letter of the law, but to go well beyond the letter to the spirit of the law -- not just for me, but for the people in the White House and in our leadership positions
We have established a whole set of rules, norms, playbooks that just keep us far away from the line Early on in the Administration, there would be questions about could a staff person go to this conference, or what should they do about this gift that was provided And I think it was maybe our first general counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said, if it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it That's a general test If it sounds like something you would enjoy or appreciate -- no go
And as a consequence -- and I'll knock on some wood here, because we got two months left -- I am extremely proud of the fact that over eight years we have not had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other Administrations And when I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House Counsel that could provide clear guideposts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity And I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it
I know what worked for us, and I think it served the American people well And because I had made a promise to the American people that I would not fall into some of the familiar habits of Washington, that I wanted a new kind of politics, this was one indicator And at the end of eight years, I think I can say to the American people I delivered on that commitment
With respect to cyber, the NSA, Admiral Rogers is a terrific patriot and has served this country well in a number of positions I generally don't comment on personnel matters here I can say generally that we've spent a lot of time over the last several years looking at how we can organize our cyber efforts to keep pace with how rapidly the environment is changing
Increasingly, our critical infrastructure, government data, financial systems are vulnerable to attack And both state and non-state actors are getting better and better at it, and it is becoming more and more rapid And it is inevitable that we're doing to have to modernize and update not just the tools we use to defend those assets and the American people, but also how we organize it And it is true that we are exploring a range of options in terms of how we organize the mission that currently exists
Rich Edson
Question: Good evening, and thank you, Mr President Earlier this year, former President George W Bush reportedly said that he worried he would be the last Republican President Now Republicans have won the White House, control the House and Senate, two-thirds of state legislatures,  governorships, and there are charges of a shallow Democratic bench behind you Are you worried you could be the last Democratic President for a while? And secondly, sir, speaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you’ve accomplished? Thank you
President Obama: Well, no, I'm not worried about being the last Democratic President I think -- not even for a while And I say that, not being cute The Democratic nominee won the popular vote, and obviously this was an extremely competitive race and I would expect that future races will be competitive as well I certainly think it's true that politics in America right now are a little up for grabs, that some of the old alignments within both parties -- Democrat and Republican -- are being reshaped And although the results of this election involved some of the specifics of the candidates and aren't going to be duplicated in every subsequent election, Democrats do have to do some thinking about how do we make sure that the message we have is received effectively and results in winning elections
This is something that I've been wrestling with throughout my presidency When you look at the proposals I put forward, they garner majority support The majority believes in raising the minimum wage The majority believes in common-sense gun safety rules The majority believes in investing to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs The majority believes in making sure that people aren't going bankrupt when they get sick The majority agrees with all the individual components of Obamacare
I think there was a Gallup Poll this week, subsequent to the election, that showed that the general public has a more favorable view of Democrats than Republicans And as I noted, my approval ratings are quite high And yet what’s been true during the course of my eight years is that does not always translate; in fact, too often it hasn't translated into working majorities either at the state level or at the federal level
Now, some of that is just the nature of our system, and geography As long as Wyoming gets the same number of senators as California, there’s going to be some tilt towards Republicans when it comes to congressional races The fact that a lot of Democratic voters are bunched up in big cities, and a lot of Republican voters are spread out across geography gives them an advantage when it comes to congressional races
Some of it is just political bad luck For example, I came in as an economy was in free fall, and although we took the right steps to save the economy, in my midterm election in , people couldn't yet see the recovery and, not surprisingly, the President’s party got punished We lost control of a lot of not just congressional seats but also gubernatorial seats and state legislative seats And that happened to be the year that the Census is done and you start doing redistricting, and those Republicans took advantage of political gerrymandering to lock in majorities, even though in numerous subsequent elections, Democrats have actually cast more votes -- or more votes have been cast for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican And yet you end up having large Republican majorities
So there are just some structural problems that we have to deal with But, look, you can't make excuses about the rules That's the deal, and we got to do better And I think doing better, as I said, involves us working at the grassroots; not ceding territory; going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning but we're building up a cadre of young talent; we're making arguments; we're persuading; we're talking about the things that matter to ordinary people, day to day, and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people’s Twitter accounts
And if we do that, then I'm confident that we'll be back on track I don't think that there has to be a complete overhaul here I think that there does have to be better organization, a smarter message And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that's just micro-targeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it's not going to win you the broad mandate that you need And ultimately, the more we can talk about what we have in common as a nation, and speak to a broad set of values, a vision that speaks to everybody and not just one group at a time, the better off we're going to be
I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get elected twice, is that I always tried to make sure that, not only in proposals but also in message, that I was speaking to everybody
You had a second part to your question?
Question: 
President Obama: Ah Look, I've said before, President Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in And my intention is to, certainly for the next two months, is finish my job And then, after that, to take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking So I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance
As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes But what I do know is, is that I have to take Michelle on vacation
Juliet Eilperin
Question: Thanks, Mr President Given what you just said about the strong differences that you and President Putin have on the future of Syria and the conflict there, can you talk a little about how you see that unfolding, both at the end of your tenure, at the beginning of Donald Trump’s, and whether you have concerns that even if we eliminate the Islamic state in eastern Syria and western Iraq, you may be allowing a permanent al Qaeda safe haven around Aleppo and  And on Aleppo, can you say to what extent you think the United States has fulfilled its responsibility to protect in that instance?
And then, in terms of finishing your job, which you just mentioned, last week you exercised your executive authority on multiple fronts -- finalizing oil and gas leasing rules on public lands, as well as issuing a five-year leasing plan, banning drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic Many Republicans say that you should hold off finalizing anymore rules as you're headed out the door because they oppose many of them -- when they control both the executive and legislative branch next year What do you say to that suggestion?
President Obama: Well, on the second question, these are the same Republicans who suggested that they didn’t need to confirm a Supreme Court justice when I was nine months out until the next election I think their general approach seems to be that probably two days after my reelection, I should stop until the next election I don't think that that's what the Constitution calls for
The regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time They’ve been subject to extensive public notice and comment, and everybody has known they’ve been out there These aren't things that we've been surprising people with They’re well-considered, they’re the right thing to do They’re part of my task of finishing my work
And I recognize that when the new Administration comes in, and a new Congress comes in, that they will have the option of trying to undo some of those rules and regulations that we've put in place And that's their prerogative That's part of how democracy works But I feel very strongly these are the right things to do, and I'm going to make sure I do them
With respect to Syria, as I said I think even on this trip in a previous press conference, I am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria Once Russia and Iran made a decision to back Assad in a brutal air campaign and essentially a pacification of Aleppo, regardless of the potential for civilian casualties, children being killed or wounded, schools or hospitals being destroyed, then it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time
And the issue that obviously I've wrestled with for the last five years -- how involved should the United States be? What are our legal constraints in such involvement? What are our moral obligations? What are our strategic interests? Those haven't changed I continue to believe that we did not have a legal basis for military intervention there; that it would have been a strategic mistake given the work we still had to do in Iraq, the counter-ISIL campaign, ongoing operations in Afghanistan; that we had worked tirelessly to arrive at a political transition of some sort that could alleviate the suffering and provide humanitarian access And we will continue to do that work all the way until the last day that me and John Kerry and others have the authority to speak for the United States government
But ultimately, it takes two -- or in this case, four, or six, or eight -- to tango And we're just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Assad, and Assad, as a consequence, has been emboldened Look, this is a man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble, and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power, when he had the option to peacefully engage in a transition that could have kept the country intact That's his mentality That's not a mentality we support That's a mentality that the Russians and the Iranians have been willing to support But at this stage, we're going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this in order for us to end the situation there
Now, our ability to go after ISIL I think can be sustained There’s no doubt that there will continue to be extremist forces in and around Syria because it's still going to be in chaos for quite some time There will be elements in Iraq, just as there have been elements in Afghanistan even after the Taliban we're swept out, even after we killed bin Laden But I think we can effectively reduce the risk and take their key external operators off the field
The thing I'm probably most concerned about is making sure that even as we do that, US policy, US statements, US positions don't further radicalize Muslims around the world, or alienate and potentially law-abiding Muslims who are living in Europe or the United States And that's why I think it's important for us to understand those are our key allies in this fight, not enemies
Mike Memoli
Question: Thank you, Mr President This final foreign trip of your presidency is obviously playing out in very different circumstances than you might have expected A very different transition is underway than the one you might have envisioned Given that, though, I wonder if you intentionally sought to approach this trip reflecting more on the powers of and influence of the presidency on the world stage so that you might be able to offer the kind of counsel to your successor that he has said he hopes to draw upon
And also, on a political note, you talked often during your reelection campaign about this fever that had consumed the Republican Party, an effective political strategy that they employed to block you even on issues where there might have been some common ground What would be your advice to Democrats who might see that kind of strategy as the same kind of path to taking back power that the Republicans employed? And related to that, what would your advice be to House Democrats about whether or not to reelect Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House?
President Obama: I'll work in reverse I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader So much of what we accomplished was accomplished because of her smarts, her tenacity, her legislative skill And I don't normally meddle with party votes, and certainly on my way out the door, probably I shouldn’t meddle here But I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill And she does stuff that's tough, not just stuff that's easy She’s done stuff that's unpopular in her own base because it's the right thing to do for the American people I think she’s a remarkable leader
With respect to Democrats and Republicans and how Democrats should deal with a new Administration, I think you give them a hearing I certainly don't want them to do what Mitch McConnell did when I was elected -- meet the day of and say our sole objective is to not cooperate with him on anything even if the country is about to go into a depression, so that we can gain seats in the midterms and ultimately defeat him
That's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games So that's not my advice to Democrats My advice to Democrats is know what you care about and what you stand for, and fight for your principles even if it's a hard fight If there are areas where the new Administration is doing something that's going to be good for the American people, find a way to work with him If you think it's going to be a problem, then say so, and make the argument
The touchstone is, what’s good for the American people And that's worked for me That means that at the end of the day -- and at the end of eight years -- I can look back and I can say that I consistently did what I thought was best It doesn’t mean you don't make mistakes, but it means that you're being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you
And in terms of reflecting on the US presidency as I've been traveling, I think the main reflection I have and the main advice that I give to the incoming President is the United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order And I say that as somebody who has gone out of his way to express respect for every country and its people, and to consistently acknowledge that many of the challenges that we face are not challenges that America can solve on its own But what I also know is that the basic framework of the world order coming out of World War II and then on through the end of the Cold War was shaped by a set of ideals and principles that have worked for the vast majority of people -- not just America, but around the world The notion of democracy and rule of law, and a free press and independent judiciary, and open markets, and a social welfare state to moderate some off the sharp edges of capitalism, and lifting up issues of human rights, and investing in public health and development not just within our own borders but elsewhere in the world And working with multilateral institutions, like the United Nations; making sure that were upholding international norms and rules
That's what’s made the modern world And there have been times where we, ourselves, have not observed some of these norms as well as we should, and have been accused of hypocrisy Here in Latin America, there have been times where countries felt disrespected and, on occasion, had cause for that There are times where we haven't observed these values in our own country and have fallen short of our ideals But that basic structure is the reason why the world is much wealthier, much more secure, and, yes, less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant than it was  years ago
And that requires constant work It doesn’t just happen on its own I've said this in Europe I've said this in places where there’s this pushback against this modern order But you take an example like Europe -- before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of  years In the second one,  million people were killed Not half a million, not a million, but  million Entire continents in rubble
In places like the Asia Pacific, before that order existed, you routinely saw famines of millions of people -- not just concerns about low wages, but people dying because they didn’t have any food or drinking water, or died of cholera or simple diseases -- if somebody had some penicillin
And so what I would say would be that we all share responsibilities for improving that order and maintaining it, and making sure it's more inclusive, and delivers greater hope and prosperity for more corners of the world We all have responsibilities -- every nation -- in respecting the dignity and worth of their citizens And America can't do it all for everybody else There are limits to our reach into other countries if they’re determined to oppress their people, or not provide girls education, or siphon off development funds into Swiss bank accounts because they’re corrupt We're not going to be able to handle every problem
But the American President and the United States of America -- if we're not on the side of what’s right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we're not able to deliver at  percent everywhere -- then it collapses And there’s nobody to fill the void There really isn't There are other very important countries -- like a China -- where if it weren't for China’s cooperation, we couldn't have gotten the Paris agreement done But China is not the one who was going around organizing  nations to sign on to a Paris agreement, or putting together the paper and the policy outlines and the conceptual framework
Russia is a very significant military power, but they’re not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti We are
And I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly And I would hope that not just the th President of the United States, but every President of the United States understands that that's not only a burden, but it's also an extraordinary privilege And if you have a chance to do that right, then you should seize it
All right? Thank you, everybody

President Obama: Hola Peru! Asu! Muchas gracias Thank you so much Thank you Everybody, please have a seat Thank you, Cyntia, for your kind words and your great work here in Peru in bringing people together across generations to meet challenges Please give Cyntia a big round of applause for the great introduction
So it is wonderful to be here in Peru I want to thank everybody at Catholic University of Peru for hosting us I want to thank the government and the people of this beautiful country for your hospitality
Audience Member: I love you!
President Obama: I love you, too!
So, while I'm here, I’m hoping to enjoy some good food -- some pollo a la brasa Maybe a pisco sour But I will not be attempting the Marinera because I usually leave the dancing to my wife, Michelle She's a better dancer than me
But I want to thank all of you for being here -- our Young Leaders of America, both live and online, representing every country in Latin America and the Caribbean
Now, this is my final stop on my final trip abroad as President of the United States And I’ve had the usual meetings with world leaders, and we've done important business But whenever I travel, one of the things that I've been trying to do for the last eight years is to meet with young people First of all, young people are more fun than old people Second, because today more than half of the world’s population is  or younger And that means your generation will determine the course of our future -- as individual nations and as a global community Now, the good news is, because I've had a chance to meet so many young people around the world, it makes me very optimistic to know that you are going to be in charge And that's why I wanted my last public event abroad to be with you
I often say to young people in my own country: If you had to be born at any time in human history, it would be right now If you think about all the progress that's been made, not just in your lifetimes, but even in the last few years, fewer people than ever around the world live in extreme poverty Scientific breakthroughs are paving the way for cures to new diseases More children are going to school; more girls in particular are going to school than ever before People across the world are securing their human rights And technology has reshaped the world, as you can tell, because everybody has their phones At a time when Earth is now populated by more cell phones than people, you have the power to connect with each other across borders, across nations You have the tools in your hand to solve problems that we couldn’t even imagine when I was your age
Now, even as we make all these important strides in advancing the rights of more people, even as technology brings us closer together, this unprecedented change also brings challenges We see it in the widening gap between the rich and the poor around the world We see it in the forces of extremism and division that too often tear communities apart So the question for all of us is, how can we make sure that in this rapidly changing world, nobody is left behind and that all of us are stronger and more prosperous?
So over the last eight years as President, I've worked to strengthen our relationship with the Americas We’re more than just neighbors -- we're linked by trade and culture, and family and values Our students study in each other’s countries Our businesses sell goods across borders Our tourists travel back and forth And we’ve moved beyond many of the old arguments to create a new vision for the future -- one that your generation, which is liberated from old ways of thinking, can lead
During my presidency, the United States recommitted itself to the region, in partnership with your countries, based on mutual interests and mutual respect We increased trade We stood up for democracy and human rights, fought against corruption and organized crime We’ve promoted clean energy We’ve led the global fight against climate change We opened a new relationship with Cuba
I strongly believe that this work has to be done with governments, but it's even more important that it's done by people -- because government is important, but it can't solve every problem So we have to work together at a people-to-people level -- teachers, and doctors, and students, and entrepreneurs, and religious leaders -- all trying to find ways in which we can promote those values of dignity and humanity and respect that so often are threatened
And that's why we developed this Young Leaders Initiative Our goal is to find the most innovative young entrepreneurs, the most energetic civil society leaders like you, and help empower you with the training, and tools and connections so you can make a difference in your communities and your countries This network already has , people This fall, we welcomed the first class of  YLAI Fellows to the United States This is just  of them They're from every country across the Americas
We want to help So we want to help this generation with grants, seed funding, skills training Today, I’m announcing the launch of the Latin American and Caribbean Civil Society Innovation Initiative Hub, which is a way to virtually connect civil society organizations across the region so you can learn from each other, share your good work, support each other We’re investing $ million in the talents and entrepreneurship of young people across the Caribbean to help start your own businesses and ventures We’re opening what we call the Global Innovation Exchange so that you can showcase your new business or enterprise to people around the world, and that way you can connect and hopefully get resources that you otherwise didn’t have
And we’re moving ahead with more education partnerships, like the , Strong in the Americas By the end of the decade, we want , US students studying in the Americas, and , students from the Americas studying in the United States And today, we’re announcing a partnership between the US Department of State, Sempra, and CAF, which is Latin America’s development bank, to fund the first Innovation Fund competition exclusively between Peruvian and US colleges and universities so students can come together to work on climate change and environmental science
So we're focused on the hemisphere, we're focused on the region But it's more than just North America, South America You're now part of a global network of young leaders from Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas who are doing amazing work in their own communities And while my time as US President is coming to an end, this network is just beginning -- it’s never been more important We need you to stay connected, work together, learn from each other, so we can build that next generation of leadership who can take on challenges like climate change and poverty, can help grow our economies, make sure that women get opportunity Make sure that every child, wherever they live, has a chance to build a good life
And I’m going to just give you some examples of the amazing people that are involved in this process We need leaders like Dr Valéry Moise As a young doctor in Haiti, Valéry saw firsthand how issues like acute malnutrition -- hunger -- affected the poorest children in his country So he and a team of social workers and doctors started an organization called Diagnostik Group, which focuses on improving health care for abandoned children at the largest pediatric hospital in Haiti His goal is for the group to become the standard for pediatric care and to expand so that he can reach even more children across Haiti So thank you, Valéry, for the great work that you are doing
We need leaders like Abbigale Loncke of Guyana Abbigale, are you here? So after struggling to find her own grandfather home care, Abbigale realized this is a problem for so many other families, so she started Community Health Care, a home care agency She started out as a service to help families take care of their loved ones but now has a social movement that also provides training and job opportunities for young women in the health care industry So thank you, Abbigale, for the great work you’re doing And you already heard the great work that Cyntia is doing right here in Peru
Across the world and across the Americas, young people are taking the lead They’re seeing problems, they’re seeing injustice, and they are finding ways to take action
And the main message I want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the United States government And we are going to work together -- we’re going to work together We expect the fellowships to continue, but I want you to know that I will also continue to be involved, even after I’m President, because I want to make sure that we continue to invest in your success If you succeed, not only do your countries succeed, but the world succeeds And I’m very excited to see all the great things you’re going to do in the future
So, muchas gracias Let’s take some questions And now we’re going to start with some questions I’m going to take off my jacket because it’s a little hot I wasn’t trying to get a cheer out of that but --
President Obama: All right, so we’re going to start with this question from this gentleman right here Please introduce yourself as you speak
Hold on, the mic is not working No, not yet Do we have a second mic? Testing -- one, two, three Hold on, here's the technical expert Here we go Here's another one Not yet? Uh-oh Uh-oh Here we go We got to try this one One of these is going to work
Question: Testing
President Obama: Oh, there you go Hey!
Question: Good afternoon, Mr President My name is Luis Santiago  I’m from Caracas, Venezuela I’m a YLAI Fellow We’re working on the first electronic health records platform for Latin America, and I was a proud member of this chord of YLAI fellows
I’m here to read a question from our YLAI network There were  questions posted on Facebook, but Carlos David Carrasco Muro from Venezuela asks: In Venezuela, there’s a debate about what matters most for stability, whether it’s peace or democracy How can we create a world where we do not have to choose between them? Both are important for development
Thank you very much
President Obama: Well, it’s a great question And it’s a timely question, because I think that after a decade in which we’ve seen more and more countries adopt democratic practices, you’re now starting to see some of those gains reversed You’re seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society And there are those who argue that democracy is incompatible with development because you need order, you need somebody from the top to tell people what to do in order to achieve
And I would just suggest that you look at the evidence over the last , ,  years Those countries that pursue democracy, that pursue transparency, where their leaders are held accountable -- those are the countries that are doing best Those countries that are repressive, that don’t respect democracy, that silence critics -- they go backwards economically
And it makes sense when you think about it, because in this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas It’s not based on how much land you have, it’s not based on natural resources It’s based on your people And in a democracy, what we’re able to do is -- people, through the freedom they enjoy, are able to create, start businesses, start organizations, solve problems And what’s also true then is, they’re able to hold the government accountable, so when the government doesn’t deliver for its people -- if it engages in corruption, if its policies only benefit a few rather than the many -- people can react and respond, and over time people get better policies from their governments
And look at what’s happened just along the coast here in Latin America If you look at Chile, Peru, Colombia -- all of them are growing faster, all of them are doing better because of the new openness and democracy that exists in these countries And what’s true here is true around the world
Now, the one thing I have to say though is, democracy is more than just elections Democracy is also a free press Democracy is also freedom of religion Democracy is making sure that the rights of minorities are protected, not just the majority Democracy is rule of law and an independent judiciary So it’s a matter of all these elements coming together
But the main thing we’ve learned is that, in this knowledge-based society, you can maintain order for a while with repressive, nondemocratic governments, but it will rot from within Over time, those governments fail and those economies fail -- because when they make mistakes, they try to hide them instead of trying to solve them When somebody has a legitimate criticism of a problem, it can be ignored because the politicians don’t have to answer And eventually, those societies end up doing much worse, oftentimes by increasing repression as people get more and more dissatisfied and then society breaks down
It’s also true, by the way, that nondemocratic countries are much more likely to get into wars with other nondemocratic countries Democracies tend to try to solve problems through diplomacy and dialogue So not only is there not a contradiction between democracy and development, it is my belief that in order, in this new knowledge-based economy, for development to be successful, you need democracy
I will say this one last thing, though Democracy can be frustrating, because democracy means that you don’t always get  percent of what you want Democracy means that sometimes you have to compromise And it means that the outcomes of elections don’t always turn out the way you would hope And then you -- we're going through that in the United States, and I'm doing everything I can to help facilitate a successful transition with the President-elect in the United States But as long as we keep our democratic systems open, then the society has a chance to try something new, and then it can make a decision and correct problems that they see in the future, and progress will continue
Good All right Let's see -- right there Yeah, you So let's get a microphone to you so we can hear you And introduce yourself By the way, I apologize, my Spanish is just okay So we're doing this in English, but hopefully I'm being clear Go ahead
Question: Hi, Mr President I'm very glad to be here -- that you are here in my country, in Peru And for me, it's an honor to be here in this conference Well, my question is, what do you think about the European Union has come together to promote military integration in defense that -- after the victory of Trump? And do you think we have global paranoia created by the media, or it's real?
President Obama: Good What's your name?
Question: Jocelyn Ramirez 
President Obama: Nice to meet you Are you a student here?
Question: I'm a student from UPC
President Obama: Fantastic Okay You have some classmates here Well, the United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain And I think it will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new President-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be -- because as I've always said, how you campaign isn’t always the same as how you govern Sometimes when you're campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions When you govern, you actually have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out how do I make this work
The alliance between the United States and Europe, through NATO, is very strong And the President-elect Trump has already reaffirmed our commitment to NATO We actually have been asking, under my administration, for Europe to carry more of the burden of defense spending than they've been doing, because the United States spends a lot more than some of our NATO partners And they recognize and acknowledge, I think, the need for them to spend more time -- more resources on that
With respect to Latin America, I don't anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration I think the work that we've done has been successful in establishing the strongest relationships between the United States and Latin America in modern history The friendships that we've established with countries like Peru, the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the investments we're making in trade, in environmental policy, and so forth -- all those things I expect to continue
There are going to be tensions that arise, probably around trade more than anything else, because the President-elect campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing some of those policies But once they look at how it's working, I think they'll determine that it's actually good both for the United States and our trading partners There may need to be modifications I've called for modifications in certain elements of our trading policy When we established the US-Peru Free Trade Agreement, one of the requirements was for Peru to strengthen its protection of labor rights, workers' rights And we did that in part because, with all of our trading partners we don’t want to be disadvantaged because we're dealing with labor that has no rights, and so it gets the lowest wages and can be exploited But we did it also because that will help lift the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru enjoy, because ultimately that's good for everybody
One of the things that I really believe is that when you pay workers well, when ordinary people are getting a decent wage and decent benefits and decent protections, then they have more money in their pockets, and then they go out and they spend that money, which is good for business, and everybody is better off So that's the kind of attitude that we want to try to promote in the years going forward And my hope is, is that that policy will continue
So my message to you, though, and the message I delivered in Europe is, don’t just assume the worst Wait until the administration is in place, it's actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it's consistent with the international community's interest in living in peace and prosperity together
Okay Good All right Okay, so what I'm doing is I'm going boy, girl, boy, girl, so that everybody gets a fair chance Okay, this gentleman right here, in the purple shirt
Question: Thank you very much First of all, I just want to say thank you for being such a great world leader over your tenure I truly think that you've done your best in making the world a better place
President Obama: I appreciate that
Question: My name is Lubi Jorges 
President Obama: Where you are from, Lubi?
Question: I'm from the Bahamas
President Obama: Hey
Question: I'm the son of two Haitian immigrants living in the Bahamas And I'm a human rights activist and also a radio talk show host I filter my advocacy work through radio, because it's a great form of communication in getting everybody involved
Nonetheless, you spoke about youth and us shaping the future and the direction of the world, and what it's going to be in the very near future But I'll give you a quick example of what I experienced and then a question that can apply to all of us here as young people
As a person being born to Haitian parents, immigrants, in the Bahamas, there is a certain perception on you not being a native And governments have fed on that over time And so the average individual that you would come into contact with, they would see you in a certain light And so the opportunities to assist then, to help your country, then are diminished For example, I'm trying to bridge the gap between Haitians and Bahamians in the Bahamas, but government officials and other individuals, they would have said, well, you're fighting for Haitians to take over the Bahamas -- when it's not that I just want Bahamians and Haitians to live in peace in the Bahamas
And so if you had the opportunity to have all of our prime ministers and presidents in one room, and you had one word of advice that you could have given those leaders in regards to young people, and especially millennials, what would you say to those leaders?
President Obama: Well, you know, I've had that opportunity a number of times They don’t always follow my advice
But to your broader point -- look, we live in a world that is smaller than ever before Because of the Internet, because of modern travel, your generation gets ideas and culture and your politics from everywhere, right? You are listening to everything from Rolling Stones, to Kendrick Lamar, to salsa, to reggaeton to right?
So what is true in music, what’s true in food is also true in terms of politics and ideas And the great thing about young people is, is that that’s made your identities both national but also international So people here are Peruvian, but you’re also people who care about what happens around this continent and around the world It means that you can be both proud of your Haitian heritage and live in the Bahamas, and also be concerned about what happens in Africa, or what is happening in Myanmar That’s a good thing
Now, I’ll be honest with you, older people sometimes are more threatened than younger people by this convergence because -- you know, now that I’ve got gray hair, I see what happens as you get older -- you get set in your ways and you are afraid of things that are new And oftentimes, politicians can feed into that sense that everything is changing so fast, let’s go back to our old identities -- identities of race or tribe or nationality
And my main advice, not just to world leaders, but more importantly to citizens around the world is, if you’re defining yourself just by what you’re not, if you’re defining yourself just by the color of your skin or where you were born, then you are not fully appreciating what will give you a strong identity and meaning in your life, and what will lead to prosperity and security for everyone And that is the values and ideals that we should all promote: That we respect everybody, regardless of what they look like That we give everybody opportunity no matter where they were born, whether they were born poor or they were born rich That we have laws that everybody has to observe, not just laws for one set of people and then a different set of laws for other people
Because the problem with that approach -- a very narrow way of thinking about yourself -- is that that means almost inevitably you have to be in conflict with somebody else If the most important thing about you is that you are an American -- if that’s the one thing that defines you -- then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities
Now, I’m a very proud American, and my job as President of the United States is to look out for American interests But my argument to the American people has always been, the best way for us to look out for American interests is to also care about what’s happening in our neighborhood Because if their house is burning down, eventually my house will burn down The best way for my daughters to be secure as Americans is to make sure that people in El Salvador or Guatemala are also feeling some security, because if they’re not, then eventually that may spill over the borders to us
And some of the challenges that we face today are ones that no single group can solve If you look at something like climate change -- that knows no borders If there is pollution in China, it affects you here in Peru If we are going to make sure that the oceans don’t rise so that suddenly all of the streets around Lima are two feet underwater, then it’s going to require everybody taking the kind of collective action that we talked about in the Paris Agreement
So I think that we should all have the capacity, and governments should reflect this capacity, to be proud of our particular circumstance, be proud that you’re Haitian, be proud that you’re in the Bahamas, be proud that you’re a young, black man Be proud of your particular identity, but also see what you have in common with people who don’t look like you or don’t come from the same place as you do Because if we see what we have in common, then we’re going to be able to work together and that’s going to be good for all of us If all we see is differences, then we’re automatically going to be in competition -- and in order for me to do well, that means I have to put you down, which then makes you want to put me down, and everybody stays down here instead of everybody lifting each other up It’s the most important thing we can do
All right, so it’s a woman’s turn Okay, everybody is pointing at this young lady All her friends were pointing at her, so she has something very important to say
Question: Welcome to Peru, Mr President
President Obama: Thank you
Question: My name is Sofia, and my friends and I are students at Laboratoria I know you have met Mariana  Do you remember about Laboratoria?
President Obama: I’m sorry, what? I’m sorry
Question: Do remember about Laboratoria?
President Obama: Yes
Question: With Mariana Costa?
President Obama: Yes, yes
Question: Okay, I’m a student over there, me and my friends We are so lucky to be studying over there to get a job in tech, but there are so many young people still without these type of opportunities So what do you recommend to open more quality education or job opportunities for young people in Latin America?
President Obama: Well, the program you described is doing great work, and there’s a lot of good work all across Latin America One of the goals is to make sure that not only are we providing a great education for people at the youngest ages -- basic reading, arithmetic, all those things -- but today you also need to have some knowledge of technology And what we’re trying to do is to work with governments and NGOs to expand access to the Internet, to digital platforms And what we also want to do then is to help design curriculum and programs through the Internet so that online learning is accessible in places where previously there might not be opportunities
And we’re seeing some of those investments here in Peru That’s part of the broader educational program that we have throughout Latin America But we can still do more And it’s not just us, it’s a public-private partnership also So having Facebook participate, and Microsoft and Google and other big companies who have an interest in an educated population -- because the more educated and more wired they are, the more, over time, customers are using their products and their platforms
What we want to do is to make sure that everybody, even in the smallest village, has suddenly this library to the world and to the best educational opportunities, even if there’s not a big university in that small town And some of the learning that we can do, it doesn’t have to be four years Sometimes, a six-week program could teach people coding in computers, and suddenly right away that person has a job, and then they can learn more and ultimately go and get a four-year education But oftentimes what you need is just that first step
And we’re doing this in the United States, by the way It's not just in Latin America In the United States, one of the things that we're finding is that we need to expand computer science and literacy in the schools We need to make sure, also, that we set up technical training systems where somebody who's unemployed in a city where there used to be a big factory but now the factory is closed; or because of automation and robots, fewer people are working there; those people who have lost their jobs, they may not be able to afford to just go to a four-year university, give them six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks of training Get them in a job right now, and then over time they can learn even more
So, congratulations You guys are doing good work
All right Okay, so this is a team effort now It's good to see this cooperation Everybody is pointing at one person All right, this gentleman right here, right in the front
Question: Hello, Mr President I'm a student representative from this beautiful university with this gorgeous group of people My name is Kai  And I'm going to give a little bit of context to my question You see, the smartest man I know is my dad My dad was born in Cuba And when he was seven years old, he went to the United States to get an opportunity He lived all of his university life there, from community college to doctorate, and he managed to do a lot of things because the USA had an open, honest towards him
Today, many immigrants can bring innovation to the USA because it has still this open, honest policy But the administration that is set to go after you is allegedly saying that it will have a closed door policy In your opinion, what do you think that today the stand of the USA is for offshore innovators that want to leave their comfort zone to the USA, to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, to find -- to strive? And what would be the damages of the USA closing their doors to these young innovators?
And a final remark, I hope you have two amazing last months of presidency
President Obama: Thank you Thank you very much Well, first of all, I know that your father is very proud that you said he's the smartest man you know I hope that Malia and Sasha would say the same thing about their father -- I don’t know But I'm sure that made him feel good
Look, America is a nation of immigrants Those of you who visited America, if you walk in an American city -- not just New York or Los Angeles, but St Louis or Indianapolis or Columbus, Ohio -- if you walk down the street, you see people that look like they could be from anyplace Because the fact is, is that except for the Native American populations, everybody in America came from someplace else All of us are immigrants And that's been our greatest strength, because we've been able to attract talent from everywhere
I use this as an example: You notice that the United States did really well in the Olympics Now, some of that is because we're a big country, we're a wealthy country, so we have all these training facilities and we can do all kinds of -- best equipment All that is true But you know what, China is a bigger country and spends a lot of money also The big advantage that America has, if you look at our team -- actually, two big advantages First, we passed something called Title IX many years ago that requires that women get the same opportunities in sports as men do And that's why -- one of the reasons the American teams did so well is the women were amazing, and just because they've gotten opportunities Right? Which teaches us something about the need to make sure that women and men, boys and girls, get the same opportunities Because you do better when everybody has a chance, not just some
But the second thing -- you look at a US Olympic team and there are all kinds of different sorts of people of all different shapes and sizes And part of it is because we draw from a bigger genetic pool than anybody -- right? We have people who -- these little gymnasts, they're like this big Simone Biles came by the White House She's a tiny little thing Amazing athlete Then we have Michael Phelps, he's '" and his shoulders are this big And that's good for swimming He couldn’t do gymnastics, but he's a really good swimmer
The point is, is that when you have all this talent from all these different places, then you actually, as a team, do better And that's been the great gift of America
Now, what we have to do not just in the United States, but in all countries, is to find a way to have a open, smart immigration policy, but it has to be orderly and lawful And I think that part of what's happened in the United States is that even though the amount of illegal immigration that is happening has actually gone down while I've been President, the perception is that it has just gone up Partly this is because it used to be that immigrants primarily stayed in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, border countries, or in Florida And now they're moving into parts of the country that aren’t used to seeing immigrants, and it makes people concerned -- who are these people, and are they taking our jobs and are they taking opportunity, and so forth
So my argument has been that no country can have completely open borders, because if they did, then nationality and citizenship wouldn’t mean anything And obviously if we had completely open borders, then you would have tens of millions of people who would suddenly be coming into the United States -- which, by the way, wouldn’t necessarily be good for the countries where they leave, because in some places like in Africa, you have doctors and nurses and scientists and engineers who all try to leave, and then you have a brain drain and they're not developing their own countries
So you have to have some rules, but my hope is, is that those rules are set up in a way that continues to invite talented young people to come in and contribute, and to make a good life for themselves What we also, though, have to do is to invest in countries that are sending migrants so that they can develop themselves So you mentioned Cuba, for example, where your father fled He left in part because they didn’t feel that there was enough opportunity there Part of the reason I said let's reopen our diplomatic relations with Cuba is to see if you can start encouraging greater opportunity and freedom in Cuba Because if you have people who have been able to leave Cuba and do really well in the United States, that means they have enough talent that they should be able to do really well by staying at home in Cuba
There are enormously talented people here in Peru I don’t want all the young people in Peru to suddenly all go -- I don’t want you to feel as if you have to go to New York in order to be successful You should be able to be successful right here in Lima, right?
So this is true in the Americas, it's true in Europe, where obviously they've been flooded -- and it's been very controversial -- with migrants, some of them displaced from war in Syria, but some of them just coming for economic reasons from Africa I just left meetings with European leaders, and we discussed the fact that if we're investing more in development in those African countries, and encouraging greater rule of law and less corruption and more opportunity in those countries, then people are less likely to want to come to Germany or Italy for their futures because they feel that they can make a future where they are
But this is an example of what I was saying earlier If we think only about, in very narrow terms, about our borders and what's good for us, and ignore what's happening everywhere else, eventually it will have an impact on us whether we like it or not Because the world is just much smaller than it used to be
Okay Let's see, we got -- all right, young lady right there Go ahead, in the black Yes, you
Question: Oh, my God, thank you for this amazing opportunity More than a question -- well, I have to introduce myself first, sorry I’m Jennifer Schell, and I’m from Venezuela We already talked a little about my country, but I just want to thank you for giving us the women’s opportunity to make us feel empowered
I’m the CEO and founder of the TrabajaMama, a social initiative that promotes values for mothers around the world I’m a mother I have a daughter, and it’s a little bit hard to become an entrepreneur And I know that you have been supporting woman empowerment You support a candidate who was a woman, Hillary You are supported by your wife, Michelle And what is --
President Obama: Michelle is amazing
Question: I’m sure, I’m sure I’m sure of that So I know how you have been telling a lot of advice for young leaders What I want -- special advice for female entrepreneurs, for those who have to strive a little bit more, for those who are mothers who have to split their self, and ask herself, should I be a mother or should I be a professional I truly believe that we can be both at the same time, but I would like to hear it from you -- an advice for all the women, potential women that are going to become a mother, will have our future generations
And on behalf of all my YLAI fellows, thank you for this amazing opportunity And all the fellows that are looking -- there are more fellows looking right now from their countries because they couldn’t come to Peru, so thank you for all the fellows that are watching right us now
President Obama: Okay Well, it’s a great question
I mean, Michelle probably would have more to say about this because, you know, she’s gone through it as a professional woman But let me offer just a few observations
First of all, the leaders and the men in every country need to understand that the countries that are most successful are going to be the countries that give opportunities to girls and women, and not just boys and men
And if you look at which countries are doing best -- most advanced, grow the fastest -- it’s partly because you can’t have half the population uneducated, not working, out of the house, not in leadership positions, and expect to be as good as a country where  percent of the people are getting a good education, and having opportunities, and can do amazing things -- starting a business or entering into politics or what have you
So this is not just a problem for girls and women; men have to also recognize, this is good for you And if you’re a strong man, you shouldn’t be threatened that women are doing well You should be proud that women are doing well And families where women have opportunity, that means they’re going to be able to bring in more income, which means the family as a whole is going to do better
And let’s be honest, sometimes, you know, that whole machismo attitude sometimes makes it harder for women to succeed, and sometimes that is coming even from those who love them So, men, those of you who end up being fathers and you’ve got daughters, you’ve got to lift up your daughters Just telling them they’re pretty is not enough You’ve got to tell them they’re smart, and you got to tell them they’re ambitious, and you have to give them opportunity
So once you have the whole country thinking in those terms, then you need to start having policies that can support women, and the most important thing, in addition to making sure that girls from an early age are getting a good education and that they’re not being told, oh, you can just do certain things -- like engineering, that’s a man’s job, or being scientist, that a man’s job No, no -- girls can do everything It can’t just be, you know, be a teacher -- which is a wonderful profession, but, traditionally, women sometimes are just told there are a few things they can do -- nurse, teacher -- as opposed to anything Right?
So that starts -- once you’ve done that, then you have to recognize that the big conflicts that women have in the professional world has to do with family and childrearing And for biological reasons, women have more of a burden than men do But it’s not just biology, it’s also sociology, all right? Men’s attitudes is, well, yeah, I don’t have to do as much And even in my marriage with Michelle, I like to think of myself as a modern, enlightened man, but I’ll admit it -- Michelle did more work than I did with Sasha and Malia
So part of what societies can do, though, is they can help with, for example, having smart policies for childcare One of the hardest things for professional women, particularly when their children are still small and not yet in school, is who’s going to take care of my baby when I’m working, and how do I make sure that they’re safe and that they’re trusted So making sure that governments have policies in place that help Now, having a mother-in-law who helps, that’s also very useful But not everybody has the option where they have family members who are close by So that’s an example of something that we have to really work on
Then we have to put pressure on institutions to treat women equally when it comes to getting loans to start a business Up until just maybe  years ago, in some places -- in the United States even -- a husband had to sign a loan document with a bank, even though it was the wife’s business, even if the woman was the one making the money, it was her idea, it was her investment, she was doing all the work Because of these old stereotypes, you’re having men co-sign That kind of mentality, that kind of discrimination still exists in a lot of institutions
So we have to push back against those, we have to fight against those Women who are successful, you have to then fight for the younger women who are coming behind you, and make sure that you are changing some of these attitudes If you are high up in a bank, then you got to make sure that these policies are good for women If you succeed in politics, then you have to help promote and encourage women who are coming behind you
So the last thing I guess I would say would be -- I know that Michelle says this to our daughters: You can be a wonderful mom and have a wonderful family and have a really successful career You may have to kind of not try to do everything all at the same time exactly You may have to time things out a little bit and have a husband who supports taking turns a little bit So it may be that when the child is very young, you’re not doing something that is as hard, because having a really young child is already really hard, and you have to sleep sometimes But then as the child gets older, maybe that’s when you are doing something -- maybe your husband is doing something that gives him more time to support that child So there’s going to have to be finding the right balance throughout your life in order to be successful
But congratulations on the good work you’re doing
All right, I've got time for -- so I only have time for two more questions I'll call on that gentleman up there with the glasses, in the blue shirt No, no, right here Let him ask his question, and then I'll ask the last one Go ahead
Question: Hello, Mr President
President Obama: Hello!
Question: It's really an honor to ask you this question Well, my name is Alonso Cornejo  worldwide -- make a change about worldwide What advice will you give? Right now we live in a world that maybe the bad is good, and the good is bad So what advice will you give them to chase their dreams, make the country better -- not Peru, just worldwide? That will be my question Thank you
President Obama: Well, look, you're already doing so well I don’t know that I can give you the perfect advice But I'll tell you what I tell my young people who work in the White House and who I meet in the United States, because I think what's true in the United States is true for you, as well
We live at a time where you're always seeing bad news Everybody -- bad news gets a lot of attention But the truth is that, in some many ways, the world is better now than it was  years ago or  years ago, or  years ago People are healthier today, they're wealthier today, they're better educated today The world, if you look overall, is less violent than it was Look at the th century -- millions of people dying everywhere Look at Latin America and the wars that were taking place everywhere across the continent And so you actually are living in a time of relative peace and historic prosperity
And I say that so that you should feel optimistic about the future You shouldn’t feel pessimistic Yeah, you're always seeing bad news, but the truth is the world is in a place where it can solve its problems and be even better  years from now or  years from now You have to start with that hope, that sense of optimism inside you, because if you don’t feel that way, then you don’t bother to try to have an impact because you think, ah, every politician is corrupt and all the governments are terrible, and people are greedy and people are mean, and so I'm just going to look out for myself And then nothing gets better So you have to start knowing that things have gotten better and can continue to get better That's number one
Number two, I always tell young people to -- and I don’t know if this translates well in Spanish -- but I say: Worry more about what you want to do, and not what you want to be Now, here is what I mean I think a lot of people, they say to themselves, "I want to be rich," or they say to themselves, "I want to be powerful" Or they say, "I want to be the President," or "I want to be a CEO," so they -- or "I want to be a rap star" So they say they have this idea, but the people I know who are most successful, usually they're successful because they found something that they really care about, and they worked at it and became really good at it And over time, because they were so good at what they did, they ended up being rich, or they ended up being powerful and influential But in the meantime, they were constantly doing what they enjoyed doing and learning, and that's what made them successful
So what I would say to all of you is, find something you care deeply about If you care about poor children, then find a way right now that you can start helping some poor children Don’t wait, saying to yourself, oh, someday, when I'm President of Peru I'm going to help poor children No, go now and find an organization or create an organization that is helping poor kids learn or be exposed to new experiences If you care about the environment, don’t wait In addition to your studies, you could start having an impact right now on trying to improve your local community, or trying to be involved in some of the work that's being done around things like climate change
The point is that once you decide what it is that you really care about, there are ways for you to now get involved and pursue that passion And if you pursue that passion and you get good at it, you're not going to change the world overnight -- nobody does I mean, I eventually, at the age of , became a senator and then the President of the United States, but I worked for  years in poor communities, and worked on issues And hopefully I was doing some good, even before I was famous or powerful, so that if I hadn’t ended up being President I could still look back and say, I worked on the things that I cared about and I got something done that was important And that, I think, is the most important advice that I have for you
All right, last question It's a woman's turn So all the men, you can put your -- all the boys can put their hands down It's a woman's turn
Okay, go ahead, right there
Question: Okay, first of all, my name is Melisa I represent Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas Besides, I'm a proud member of UPC  And once again, I want to welcome you to this amazing country And on behalf of this whole audience, I would like to thank you for this amazing opportunity
Okay, so my question is the following As it is well known, during your presidency you have stepped up and accepted mistakes you made yourself or maybe the team you're leading And that's -- I believe that shows how you reaffirm your belief in introspection and how you want to leave the past behind What would your advice to us entrepreneurs, most of us, that would like to leave the mistakes -- learn from them, step up, and leave what's the past in the past? Thank you, President
President Obama: Well, you know, I don’t -- you shouldn’t ignore the past You should learn from it And you should learn from history, and learn from experience
The truth is that I was -- right before I came to Peru, I was in Europe, and I started my trip in Athens And I went to the Parthenon, the birthplace of democracy And you look at all these buildings from ancient Greece, and you try to imagine all the things that were happening in that time, and it seems very long ago But the fact of the matter is, is that humanity keeps on making the same mistakes, and we oftentimes find ourselves dealing with the same problems and the same issues So studying our past, studying our history, is very, very important
But the main thing I tell you and I tell my own daughters is, you can't be trapped by the past There's a difference between understanding your past You need to know the history of Peru If you live in the United States, you need to know how America came about -- and that includes both the amazing and wonderful things, but also the bad things If you want to understand America today, then you have to understand slavery, and you have to understand the history of immigration, and how the debates we’re having today about immigration aren’t that different from when the Irish or the Italians came and people were saying, we can’t have any more Italians and we can’t have any more Irish If you don’t know that then you aren’t going to understand the patterns that we are having today
But the point is, is that we have the power to make our own history We don’t have to repeat the same mistakes We don’t have to just be confined to what has happened before or what is going on today We can think differently, and imagine differently, and do things differently
The one thing that we should remember, though, is that even as we try to do things that are new, we should remember that change generally doesn’t happen overnight It happens over time So I say that to young people because sometimes they get impatient In the United States, sometimes people say to me, oh, why haven’t we eliminated racial discrimination in the United States? And I say, well, we’ve made a lot of progress since I was born In terms of human history, if you think on the scale of hundreds of years or thousands of years -- in  years, the changes that have taken place have been amazing
So you have to understand that even though we can think differently, societies don’t move immediately It requires hard work, and you have to persuade people And sometimes you take two steps forward and then you take one step back And you shouldn’t be discouraged when that happens, because history doesn’t just move in a smooth, straight line
The good news is that we have more access to information than we’ve ever had before Young people are in a position to change the world faster than ever before And I am confident that if you are respectful of people and you look for what you have in common with humanity, if you stay true to the values of kindness, and respect, and reason, and trying to live together in peace, that the world will keep getting better And I’ll be looking forward to seeing all the amazing things that you do in the years to come
Okay? Thank you very much, everybody
Thank you

Chancellor Merkel: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to be able to welcome today for the sixth time the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to Germany
In his capacity as President of the United States, let us remind ourselves -- visiting us in his capacity as candidate here in Berlin; we then met in Baden-Baden We then met in Dresden and Buchenwald We saw each other when he gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate In Elmau, we met again at the G Then Hannover Faire comes to mind And today he is again here in Berlin
So eight years are coming to a close This is the last visit of Barack Obama to our country, to Germany I am very glad that he chose Germany as one of the stopovers on this trip And thank you very much Thank you for the friendship you’ve always demonstrated Thank you for the reliable friendship and partnership you demonstrated in very difficult hours of our relationship So let me again pay tribute to what we've been able to achieve, to what we discussed, to what we were able to bring about in difficult hours
It comes to mind, as I said, of those that had a bearing on the cooperation of our intelligence services, and I'm very grateful that Barack Obama, as President, very much put protection of privacy on the agenda today Due to the fact of Islamist terrorism all over the world and the threat of IS, we recognize how important the cooperation with intelligence services, first and foremost, also with the services of the United States is We need this cooperation And we say this from a German perspective very clearly and unequivocally
Our bilateral relations are very good, they’re very close In the areas of business, of the economy, the United States of America last year were our most important trading partner Both for Germany and the European Union, the European Union and the United States of America on the big, important economic areas for us, which is why I've always come out strongly in favor of concluding a trade agreement with the United States of America
We have made progress, quite a lot of progress They cannot be stopped, those negotiations But we’ll keep what we have achieved so far, and I'm absolutely certain that one day we will come back to what we have achieved and build on it
Because that is my deep conviction Globalization -- and I think we share this conviction -- is that globalization needs to be shaped politically It needs to be given a human face But we cannot allow to fall back into pre-globalization times So this conclusion of trade agreements that go beyond the scope of mere tariff agreements, customs agreements, are most important, and I'm very pleased that we were able to bring this to fruition between Canada and the EU
We made great progress, particularly if we look at one of the great global issues -- namely, climate protection Without the engagement of the current Administration under the leadership of Barack Obama, this Paris agreement would never have come about There has been a change in the attitude in the United States towards that agreement, but there is also better cooperation with China So last year, we were able to conclude a Paris climate agreement, which will lead the way for the rest of the world, which is ground-breaking And together with the sustainable development goals of the agenda  for the whole world, this is indeed a sea change, I think, that we see here, and, step-by-step, it will be implemented
There’s another point that I wanted to mention here, particularly, the engagement and commitment to Africa For us Europeans, Africa as a neighboring continent is of prime importance The development of African countries is in our very own vested interest We, as Germans, but also we, as members of the European Union, will have to deal with this It will be at the very top of our agenda
There are a lot of areas where we cooperate -- the fight against ISIL, for example Here, Germany was able to contribute to a certain extent, in certain areas We'll continue to do so -- for example, in supporting the Peshmerga, in air policing But we also have to acknowledge that the United States of America bear most of the burden They bear the brunt of this responsibility
So I take your remarks very seriously, Barack, that the European Union as a whole, but also Germany, needs to recognize that this is our alliance, our common alliance, our transatlantic alliance, that we have to step up our engagement Because, in the long run, we will not be allowed to accept this imbalance as regards the contributions we give to this alliance And we have understood this message, and we have started to react
We have worked very closely together, for example, in Afghanistan We're continuing to do so I'm very pleased that this military engagement, together with a political road map that we've developed, we were able to continue We want to bring about a political solution there
We work very closely together on the issue of annexation of Crimea and Russia’s attempt to actually conquer Ukraine And actually they did so -- conquered part of the territory We tried to come to a peaceful settlement here on this
So our interests are very much aligned Our attempts of cooperation are very much aligned We continue to build on what we've already achieved in these last months of the Administration, and we will continue also with the new Administration
This is the end of an eight-year cooperation that was very close, indeed From a German point of view, German-American and European-American relations are a pillar of our foreign policy -- a foreign policy that is obviously guided by interests, but that is very much also committed to shared values So we have a platform -- democracy, freedom, respect of human rights -- that we would like to see respected all over the world, and also a peaceful world order We have shared those values; we continue to share those values And obviously we will continue to cooperate with the new Administration
But today, I think a word of gratitude is at hand Thank you very much for this very close, very intensive cooperation
President Obama: Well, thank you so much It is wonderful to be back in Berlin This is my sixth visit to Germany It will not be my last I have somehow continued to miss Oktoberfest So that's probably something that is better for me to do as a former President rather than as President -- I'll have more fun
It's also wonderful to be back with my great friend and ally, Chancellor Merkel As I reflect back over the past eight years, I could not ask for a steadier or a more reliable partner on the world stage, often through some very challenging times
So I want to thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and your commitment to our alliance And I want to thank the German people for the incredible partnership that our countries have been able to establish all these years
Last week marked the th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall The United States was proud to stand with the people of Germany as this nation and this continent reunited, and rebuilt, and reached for a better future And it’s a reminder that the commitment of the United States to Europe is enduring and is rooted in the values we share -- values that Angela just mentioned: Our commitment to democracy; our commitment to rule of law; our commitment to the dignity of all people -- in our own countries and around the world
Our alliance with our NATO partners has been a cornerstone of US foreign policy for nearly  years -- in good times and in bad, and through Presidents of both parties -- because the United States has a fundamental interest in Europe’s stability and security The commitment that Angela and I share to this guiding principle has formed the basis for our conversations this afternoon
We discussed our efforts to keep our countries competitive and to create jobs and opportunity on both sides of the Atlantic The negotiations on agreements like T-TIP have been challenging, and obviously at a moment when there’s concerns about globalization and the benefits that accrue to particular people, it is important that those negotiations and channels of communication remain Because, ultimately, what we have shown over the last several decades is that markets and trade and commerce can create prosperity in all of our countries -- that it's not a win-lose situation, but it can be a win-win situation
And at a time when the European project is facing challenges, it’s especially important to show the benefits of economic integration by continuing to invest in our people and working to reduce inequality, both within and across our countries
I reiterated our hope that negotiations over the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU will be conducted in a smooth and orderly and transparent fashion, and preserve as closely as possible the economic and political and security relationships between the UK and EU And I continue to believe what I said in Hannover -- that the EU remains one of the world's great political and economic achievements and that those achievements should not be taken for granted, that they need to be nurtured and cultivated and protected and fought for
Because the achievements that we've seen on this continent, in contrast to a divided Europe of the previous century, are ones that remind us of how important it is that we work together, and that we are willing to uphold principles that have resulted in unprecedented prosperity and security throughout Europe and around the world
With the threat of climate change only becoming more urgent, Angela and I focused on the need for American and EU leadership to advance global cooperation Both our nations were proud to join the Paris climate agreement, which the world should work to implement quickly Continued global leadership on climate, in addition to increasing private investment in clean energy is going to be critical to meeting this growing threat
Of course, we discussed our commitment to meeting shared security challenges -- from countering cyber threats to ensuring that Iran continues to live up to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal I commended Angela for her leadership, along with President Hollande, in working to resolve the conflict in Ukraine We continued to stand with the people of Ukraine and for the basic principle that nations have a right to determine their own destiny And we discussed the importance of maintaining sanctions until Russia fully complies with the Minsk agreement
As part of the coalition against ISIL, we are putting that terrorist network under tremendous pressure Here in Berlin, this week, coalition members are meeting to ensure we remain unified and focused on our mission to destroy ISIL We are very grateful for the vital contributions Germany has made to this fight -- training local forces in Iraq, sharing intelligence, providing reconnaissance aircraft, including the recent deployment of additional NATO AWACS And as Iraqi forces continue the liberation of Mosul, I am pleased that NATO will be meeting the commitment we made in Warsaw to begin training additional forces in Iraq, which started this January
We also continue to stand united with Germany and our NATO allies in our ongoing efforts to build peace and stability in Afghanistan
On Syria, it's clear that the indiscriminate attacks on civilians by the Assad regime and Russia will only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe, and that a negotiated end to the conflict is the only way to achieve lasting peace in Syria Angela and I also agreed on the need for a comprehensive and humane response to the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria and for the influx of migrants and refugees from around the world
We need to build on the progress achieved at the UN Refugee Summit, which yielded new commitments from some  nations and organizations The United States is doing our part by increasing the number of refugees we resettle And I want again to commend Angela and, more importantly, the German people for the extraordinary leadership and compassion that you have shown in the face of what I know is a very difficult challenge You are not alone in trying to deal with this challenge This is not an issue that any one country should bear but is in need of an international response And I not only intend to make sure that we have put in place more robust support from the United States, but I'm hoping that that continues beyond my Administration
On this final visit, I am reminded of the visit I made here before I became President It was eight years ago I had no gray hair But I believe today what I said then: If you want a model for what is possible, if you want to see how to build a peaceful and prosperous and dynamic society, then look at Berlin and look at Germany Look at Chancellor Merkel Her personal story helps to tell the story of incredible achievement that the German people have embarked on and I think is something that you should be very proud of
It is not inevitable that we make progress; it requires hard work Sometimes it may seem as if progress is stalled But what the history of postwar Germany shows is that strength and determination and focus and adherence to the values that we care about will result in a better future for our children and our grandchildren
And on behalf of the American people, I want to thank the German people, I want to thank Chancellor Merkel, for your deep friendship and your steadfast partnership Vielen dank 
Mr Earnest: Jeff Mason from Reuters
Question: Thank you very much Mr President, you and the President-elect have very different views on Russia After your meeting with him last week, can you assure Chancellor Merkel that a Trump Administration would also support strong sanctions against Moscow? Similarly, what have you told President Putin about Russia's influence on the US election? And how would you advise European countries to deal with the same threat? And lastly, if I may, would you like to see your friend, Chancellor Merkel, run for reelection next year? 
President Obama: Uh-oh Pull out your German, showing off
Question:  Has the American President calmed you in the sense that on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia -- he has allayed your fears? And are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr Trump, would you -- as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again?
President Obama: Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so, in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last eight years And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding
So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds If I were here and I were German, and I had a vote, I might support her But I don't know whether that hurts or helps
With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office Russia is an important country It is a military superpower It has influence in the region and it has influence around the world And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation
I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing, and they are having good relationships with their neighbors, and participating constructively on big issues like climate change So I’ve sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world
The values that we talked about -- the values of democracy, and free speech, and international norms, and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity -- those things are not something that we can set aside
And so on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we’ve had very significant differences And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms
And I don’t expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria -- that we just do whatever is convenient at the time And that will be something that I think we’ll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together
I am encouraged by the President-elect’s insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security I think is very important
And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyberattacks This isn’t new It’s not unique to Russia There are a number of states where we’ve seen low-level cyberattacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, though we recognize Russia’s intelligence-gathering will sometimes take place even if we don’t like it, there’s a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we’re monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening
I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don’t see a cyber arms race A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn’t become a lawless, low-level battlefield
And we’ve started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G, the G, and at the UN levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front
Chancellor Merkel:  Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I’m very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly Because this is all about the American people, it’s about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing Administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming Administration And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany And that is in our mutual interest
So we will continue this I will continue this with -- I approach this with an open mind, and I’ll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump
Secondly, on Russia I can only repeat what the President said previously This is all about respecting certain principles And I’m saying this from a European vantage point, from a German vantage point So the fact that for over  years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts
But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts This is why we launched the Normandy Process, in close coordination with the United States of America And particularly from a German perspective, from the European perspective, I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor Just look at Poland -- the sort of European perspective this has So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share But this mustn’t keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but, again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements
And this what I’m going to continue to work on with all my heart So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today
Question: Mr President, your country is divided You, as first black President, as first African American President, who did so many things so differently, who raised so much hope all over the world -- do you think that you have, perhaps in a way, put too much of a strain, maybe too much of demands on the Americans? And to what extent do you think your successor may well be a threat to the rest of the world, to the security? Because there are, after all, nuclear weapons here in Germany to which he has access now
Will you want to now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under the your Administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well?
And a personal question President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician You are somewhat more sober when you describe your partner How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner?
President Obama: My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it’s not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world
And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I’ve done a pretty good job, that we haven’t, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it
But what is certainly true is that the American people -- just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world -- are seeing extraordinarily rapid change The world is shrinking Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security They’re looking for some means of control
And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe, or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries
And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them but also change governments if they're not serving them well -- then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue
And I think it’s especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it’s particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries -- those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization -- and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways
And I think that can be done But it’s hard It requires creativity It requires effective communications Part of what’s changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies But we’ll figure it out
So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America’s future, but the direction that the world is going in And part of what makes me most optimistic is if you look at the attitudes of young people Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences They are much more comfortable with diversity They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between “us” and “them” They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully, and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders
So that's where the future is But we have to create that bridge to the future And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped get us here And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine
Chancellor Merkel:  On the issue first of independence of Germany, after the time of national socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America The fact that we were able to enjoy German unification is due first and foremost to the help of the United States of America And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed, and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country
Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be  years ago And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution We will all have to do more in development cooperation It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate -- which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union We cannot stand alone with  million people In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much -- even though you may be economically strong So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole
Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at -- and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States Look at the European Parliament There are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, who are sort of preaching policies of -- well, very unfriendly policies We have them here in Europe, too We have them here in Germany, too
And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society Look at the history of the printing press -- when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had Or industrialization -- what sort of consequences that had Very often it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a translation from agricultural societies to industrial societies
Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country We have it in other countries Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days -- trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place
But those that belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others -- that is something that we cannot allow to happen That is something that I think, at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people -- that was something that filled me with great joy But the fact that this people have hijacked it is not something that fills me with great joy We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so
Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult But we are politicians We all know that democracy lives off change So in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this It's a tough rule -- eight years and that's it Out goes the President and a new one comes in So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead But personal -- we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say
Mr Earnest: The next question will come from Margaret Brennan at CBS News
Question: Thank you very much, Mr President You've spoken a great deal about what you've characterized as kind of a crude form of nationalism perhaps on the rise I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks
Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?
Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Assad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem?
President Obama: One of the great things about our democracy is it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting I've been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign -- I wouldn't advise them to be silent
What I would advise -- what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election -- is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter And what I consistently say to young people -- I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe -- do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life
I think there is a tendency -- because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up -- there is a tendency I think to assume that that's always the case And it's not Democracy is hard work
In the United States, if  percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not -- and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones -- if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process, and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down
And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there’s an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks
It’s hard work And the good news is I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward
But I do think sometimes there’s complacency Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the Cold War, who forget what it meant to have a wall And I’ll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where and easily equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia, and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate -- where those distinctions aren’t made
I’ve said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws, we’ve operated imperfectly There are times when we’ve made mistakes There are times where I’ve made mistakes, or our Administration hasn’t always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with It’s a work of constant improvement
But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties, and an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption -- those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country but also with respect to our foreign policy
And that should be remembered Because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation -- and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television -- where some overzealousness on the part of a US official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere -- if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect We won’t know what to fight for And we can lose so much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted
That was a long answer, wasn’t it? I don’t remember if there was a second part to it I got all caught up in that one
Question: I asked you if you advised the President-elect on things --
President Obama: Yes, I did I did He ran a extraordinarily unconventional campaign, and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history -- American history And that means that he now has to transition to governance And what I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn’t support him
And he’s indicated his willingness to -- his understanding of that But you’re absolutely right that that has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his Administration And my hope is, is that that’s something he is thinking about, because not only is the President of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways
Question: And Syria?
President Obama: With respect to Syria, we are going to continue to work, as we have over the last five, six years, to push towards a political transition and settlement
It would be naïve of me to suggest that with Russia committed militarily as it is to supporting what, in many cases, are barbarous tactics by the Assad regime to crush the opposition, the sort of indiscriminate bombing that we’ve been seeing not just in Aleppo but in many parts of the country over the last several years -- it would be naïve of me to suggest that there’s going to be a sudden, -degree turn in policy by either Assad or Russia or Iran at this point But we are going to continue to make the argument We are going to continue to try to find humanitarian steps that can reach the people there We’re going to continue to try to obtain Cessations of Hostilities that lessen the human tragedy and the migration that’s taking place
But, ultimately, the way this is going to be resolved is going to have to be a recognition by Russia, and a willingness to pressure Assad that a lasting, durable peace with a functioning country requires the consent of people You cannot purchase people’s consent through killing them They haven’t made that transition yet, but we’re going to keep on trying
Chancellor Merkel:  I think I can speak for the whole of the federal government when I say that we are no longer in election mode in the United States, we’re in post-election mode There is an interest of the Federal Republic of Germany to cooperate well with the United States of America This goes for each and every President on the basis of shared values, and I believe that these are, indeed, shared values, and should be shared values
So as to my position on President Assad, Assad as President has actively tried to kill his own people He has bombed them with barrel bombs in a most terrible way He has brought untold suffering over his people -- if you look at Aleppo and other places When you talk to the many Syrian refugees who have fled here to Germany, they will be able to tell you their own personal story, and the majority of them -- the great majority of them -- fled from Assad, and most of them not even fled the IS So I don’t see him as an ally
Question: Thank you very much Mr President, you describe your hopes rather more in great historical terms Let me break this down to months and years The fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist, meeting Mr Farage, and the fact that prominent Republican representatives did not decide to join this transition team -- what makes you confident, against the background of this, that President Trump can be a reliable partner to the world and to Europe and Germany?
Now, Madam Chancellor, if you hear those words of praise of the President with regard to you -- this, what he said, can this not sort of demand too much from you and from Germany? Because too much is demanded, too much is expected from you -- too great are the expectations, you can’t meet them?
President Obama: I’m always optimistic There were times where I was in the Oval Office and people would come to me with all kinds of political problems and policy problems and international problems, and my team would be getting discouraged and depressed, and I would say to them, I have to be optimistic, because the odds of somebody named Barack Obama being President of the United States were very low, and the fact that, in my lifetime, I have seen such enormous, positive change in the United States and around the world tells me that, although history does not travel in a straight line, it moves in the direction of justice and freedom and a better life for people But we have to fight for it We have to work for it
What makes me cautiously optimistic about my successor and the shift from campaign mode to governance is there’s something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States -- not just by its own people but by people around the world -- that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness And if you’re not serious about the job, then you probably won’t be there very long because it will expose problems
Even when you’re doing a job, even when you are attentive, there are so many things that come across your desk that people are going to question you, and you’re going to have opponents and you’re going to have critics, and you figure that out pretty fast when you’re sitting there And I think the President-elect is going to see fairly quickly that the demands and responsibilities of a US President are not ones that you can treat casually, and that in a big, complex, diverse country, the only way that you can be successful is by listening and reaching out and working with a wide variety of people
And so it is my hope that that is what will happen And I’m going to do everything I can over the next two months to help assure that that happens
It is absolutely true that Chancellor Merkel is going to have significant responsibilities, has had extraordinary burdens that she’s had to carry If she chooses to continue, you're right, she will have big burdens I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she’s tough And I have -- I know what it means to carry burdens because the fact of the matter is, is that if there are problems around the world, the first question people ask is, why isn’t Washington doing something about it?
This is why it’s so important not to discount or take for granted the importance of the Transatlantic Alliance And this is probably the best place for me to end
In international for a -- in Gs, in Gs, in the United Nations -- the United States and Germany are not always perfectly aligned America and Europe are not always perfectly aligned But the voice that speaks out on behalf of some dissident who is jailed halfway around the world, the voice who is expressing concern about some child in an African village who doesn't have clean drinking water or is subject to some terrible disease, the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible -- that's our voice more often than not
And we're not always successful But if that voice is absent, or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world And we have to remember that And whoever is the US President, and whoever is the Chancellor of Germany, and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world -- they need to recognize that
There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else’s problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient And if we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world We will go backwards instead of forwards
So whoever the US President is, whoever the Chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that And our citizenry who decide who our Presidents and Chancellors are need to remember that
Chancellor Merkel:  It is, after all, a very good thing if, after eight years of cooperation, the President of the United States says that this is a cooperation based on friendship, that we cooperated well I feel that this is a very good, a very positive message, and, indeed, an encouragement for me
Now, secondly, I, fortunately, know very many people -- and there are many, many more that I don't know, and many politicians -- who stand up for the same values of democracy, of liberal societies, of open societies, of respect for the dignity of man And I feel that we are in a community of people here who stand up for these values, who try to maintain them, and wherever they are not yet respected, stand up for people’s rights to enjoy them, as well
And this is worth every effort But I think we're gratified to know that there are many, many people who feel committed to this goal
Thank you very much

Hello, Greece! Yia sas! Kalispera!  To the government and the people of Greece -- including Prime Minister Tsipras, who I thank for his partnership and for being here, along with so many young people, the future of Greece -- I want to thank you for your warm and generous welcome
As many of you know, this is my final trip overseas as President of the United States, and I was determined, on my last trip, to come to Greece -- partly because I’ve heard about the legendary hospitality of the Greek people -- your philoxenia Partly because I had to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon But also because I came here with gratitude for all that Greece -- “this small, great world” -- has given to humanity through the ages
Our hearts have been moved by the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides Our minds have been opened by the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides Our understanding of the world and our place in it has been expanded by Socrates and Aristotle
In the United States, we’re especially grateful for the friendship of so many proud Greek Americans In my hometown of Chicago -- you can find them in Greektown, with their fustanellas And together, we’ve celebrated Greek Independence Day at the White House We’ve had some spanakopita and some ouzo Greek Americans have worn the uniform to keep our country free Greek Americans have marched with Dr Martin Luther King, Jr to make us more just Greek or American, we’re all cheering for Giannis Antetokounmpo -- who seems to be getting better each year And if anyone seeks an example of our shared spirit, our resilience, they need look no further than New York City, near Ground Zero, where the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, once in ruins, is now rising again
Most of all, we’re indebted to Greece for the most precious of gifts -- the truth, the understanding that as individuals of free will, we have the right and the capacity to govern ourselves For it was here,  centuries ago, in the rocky hills of this city, that a new idea emerged Demokratia Kratos -- the power, the right to rule -- comes from demos -- the people The notion that we are citizens -- not servants, but stewards of our society The concept of citizenship -- that we have both rights and responsibilities The belief in equality before the law -- not just for a few, but for the many; not just for the majority, but also the minority These are all concepts that grew out of this rocky soil
Of course, the earliest forms of democracy here in Athens were far from perfect -- just as the early forms of democracy in the United States were far from perfect The rights of ancient Athens were not extended to women or to slaves But Pericles explained, “our constitution favors the many instead of the few…this is why it is called a democracy”
Athenians also knew that, however noble, ideas alone were not enough To have meaning, principles must be enshrined in laws and protected by institutions, and advanced through civic participation And so they gathered in a great assembly to debate and decide affairs of state, each citizen with the right to speak, casting their vote with a show of hands, or choosing a pebble -- white for yes, black for no Laws were etched in stone for all to see and abide by Courts, with citizen jurors, upheld that rule of law
Politicians weren’t always happy because sometimes the stones could be used to ostracize, banish those who did not behave themselves
But across the millennia that followed, different views of power and governance have often prevailed Throughout human history, there have been those who argue that people cannot handle democracy, that they cannot handle self-determination, they need to be told what to do A ruler has to maintain order through violence or coercion or an iron fist There’s been a different concept of government that says might makes right, or that unchecked power can be passed through bloodlines There’s been the belief that some are superior by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, and those beliefs so often have been used to justify conquest and exploitation and war
But through all this history, the flame first lit here in Athens never died It was ultimately nurtured by a great Enlightenment It was fanned by America’s founders, who declared that “We, the People” shall rule; "that all men are created equal" and "endowed by  Creator with certain inalienable rights"
Now, at times, even today, those ideals are challenged We’ve been told that these are Western ideals We’ve been told that some cultures are not equipped for democratic governance and actually prefer authoritarian rule And I will say that after eight years of being President of the United States, having traveled around the globe, it is absolutely true that every country travels its own path; every country has its own traditions But what I also believe, after eight years, is that the basic longing to live with dignity, the fundamental desire to have control of our lives and our future, and to want to be a part of determining the course of our communities and our nations -- these yearnings are universal They burn in every human heart
It’s why a Greek bishop atop a mountain raised the flag of independence It’s why peoples from the Americas to Africa to Asia threw off the yoke of colonialism It’s why people behind an Iron Curtain marched in Solidarity, and tore down that wall, and joined you in a great union of democracies It’s why, today, we support the right of Ukrainians to choose their own destiny; why we partner with Tunisians and the people of Myanmar as they make historic transitions to democracy
This has been my foreign policy during my presidency By necessity, we work with all countries, and many of them are not democracies Some of them are democracies in the sense they have elections, but not democracies in the sense of actually permitting participation and dissent But our trajectory as a country has been to support the efforts of those who believe in self-governance, who believe in those ideas that began here so many years ago
And it is not simply a matter of us being true to our values It’s not just a matter of idealism I believe it is practical for the United States to support democracies Because history shows us that countries with democratic governance tend to be more just, and more stable, and more successful
Open, democratic societies can deliver more prosperity --because when people are free to think for themselves and share ideas and discover and create -- the young people who are here, what they’re able to do through the Internet and technology, that’s when innovation is unleashed, when economies truly flourish That’s when new products, and new services, and new ideas wash through an economy In contrast to regimes that rule by coercion, democracies are rooted in consent of the governed -- citizens know that there’s a path for peaceful change, including the moral force of nonviolence And that brings a stability that so often can facilitate economic growth
The history of the past two centuries indicates that democracies are less likely to fight wars among themselves So more democracy is good for the people of the world, but it’s also good for our national security Which is why America’s closest friends are democracies -- like Greece It’s why we stand together in NATO -- an alliance of democracies
In recent years, we’ve made historic investments in NATO, increased America’s presence in Europe, and today’s NATO -- the world’s greatest alliance -- is as strong and as ready as it’s ever been And I am confident that just as America’s commitment to the transatlantic alliance has endured for seven decades --whether it’s been under a Democratic or Republican Administration -- that commitment will continue, including our pledge and our treaty obligation to defend every ally
Our democracies show that we’re stronger than terrorists, and fundamentalists, and absolutists who can’t tolerate difference, can’t tolerate ideas that vary from their own, who try to change people’s way of life through violence and would make us betray or shrink from our values Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIL
Because our democracies are inclusive, we’re able to welcome people and refugees in need to our countries And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece The Greek people’s generosity towards refugees arriving on your shores has inspired the world That doesn’t mean that you should be left on your own -- and only a truly collective response by Europe and the world can ensure that these desperate people receive the support that they need Greece cannot be expected to bear the bulk of the burden alone -- but the fact that your democracy opens your heart to people in need in a way that might not otherwise be the case
Just as democracies are premised on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within our societies, we also believe that cooperation and dialogue is the best way to address challenges between nations And so it is my belief that democracies are more likely to try to resolve conflicts between nations in a way that does not result in war That’s how, with diplomacy, we were able to shut down Iran’s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot With diplomacy, the United States opened relations with Cuba With diplomacy, we joined Greece and nearly  nations in the most ambitious agreement ever to save our planet from climate change
And speaking of climate change, I would point out that there is a connection between democracy and science The premise of science is that we observe and we test our hypotheses, our ideas We base decisions on facts, not superstition; not what our ideology tells us, but rather what we can observe And at a time when the globe is shrinking and more and more we’re going to have to take collective action to deal with problems like climate change, the presence of a democratic debate allows the science to flourish and to shape our collective responses
Now, democracy, like all human institutions, is imperfect It can be slow; it can be frustrating; it can be hard; it can be messy Politicians tend to be unpopular in democracies, regardless of party, because, by definition, democracies require that you don’t get a hundred percent of what you want It requires compromise Winston Churchill famously said "that democracy is the worst form of government" -- except for all the others And in a multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural society, like the United States, democracy can be especially complicated Believe me, I know
But it is better than the alternatives because it allows us to peacefully work through our differences and move closer to our ideals It allows us to test new ideas and it allows us to correct for mistakes Any action by a President, or any result of an election, or any legislation that has proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy
And throughout our history, it’s how we have come to see that all people are created equal -- even though, when we were founded, that was not the case We could work to expand the rights that were established in our founding to African Americans, and to women, to Americans with disabilities, to Native Americans; why all Americans now have the freedom to marry the person they love It’s why we welcome people of all races and all religions and all backgrounds, and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life and who make our country stronger
And so here, where democracy was born, we affirm once more the rights and the ideals and the institutions upon which our way of life endures: freedom of speech and assembly -- because true legitimacy can only come from the people, who must never be silenced; a free press to expose injustice and corruption and hold leaders accountable; freedom of religion -- because we’re all equal in the eyes of God; independent judiciaries to uphold rule of law and human rights; separation of powers to limit the reach of any one branch of government; free and fair elections -- because citizens must be able to choose their own leaders, even if your candidate doesn’t always win
We compete hard in campaigns in America and here in Greece But after the election, democracy depends on a peaceful transition of power, especially when you don’t get the result you want
And as you may have noticed, the next American President and I could not be more different We have very different points of view, but American democracy is bigger than any one person That’s why we have a tradition of the outgoing President welcoming the new one in -- as I did last week And why, in the coming weeks, my Administration will do everything we can to support the smoothest transition possible -- because that’s how democracy has to work
And that’s why, as hard as it can be sometimes, it’s important for young people, in particular, who are just now becoming involved in the lives of their countries, to understand that progress follows a winding path -- sometimes forward, sometimes back -- but as long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don’t waver from those central principles that ensure a lively, open debate, then our future will be okay, because it remains the most effective form of government ever devised by man
It is true, of course, over the last several years that we’ve seen democracies faced with serious challenges And I want to mention two that have an impact here in Greece, haven an impact in the United States, and are having an impact around the world
The first involves the paradox of a modern, global economy The same forces of globalization and technology and integration that have delivered so much progress, have created so much wealth, have also revealed deep fault lines Around the world, integration and closer cooperation, and greater trade and commerce, and the Internet -- all have improved the lives of billions of people -- lifted families from extreme poverty, cured diseases, helped people live longer, gave them more access to education and opportunity than at any time in human history
I’ve often said to young people in the United States, if you had to choose a moment in history to be born, and you did not know ahead of time who you would be -- you didn’t know whether you were going to be born into a wealthy family or a poor family, what country you’d be born, whether you were going to be a man or a woman -- if you had to choose blindly what moment you’d want to be born: You’d choose now Because the world has never, collectively, been wealthier, better educated, healthier, less violent than it is today That’s hard to imagine, given what we see in the news, but it’s true And a lot of that has to do with the developments of a integrated, global economy
But trends underway for decades have meant that in many countries and in many communities there have been enormous disruptions Technology and automation mean that goods can be produced with fewer workers It means jobs and manufacturing can move across borders where wages are lower or rights are less protected And that means that workers and unions oftentimes have less leverage to bargain for better wages, better benefits, have more difficulty competing in the global marketplace Hardworking families worry their kids may not be better off than they were because of this global competition
What we’ve also seen is that this global integration is increasing the tendencies towards inequality, both between nations and within nations, at an accelerated pace And when we see people -- global elites, wealthy corporations -- seemingly living by a different set of rules, avoiding taxes, manipulating loopholes -- when the rich and the powerful appear to game the system and accumulate vast wealth while middle and working-class families struggle to make ends meet, this feeds a profound sense of injustice and a feeling that our economies are increasingly unfair
This inequality now constitutes one of the greatest challenges to our economies and to our democracies An inequality that was once tolerated because people didn’t know how unequal things were now won’t be tolerated because everybody has a cellphone and can see how unequal things are The awareness that people have in the smallest African village, they can see how people in London or New York are living The poorest child in any of our countries now has a sense of what other people have that they don’t So not only is there increasing inequality, but also there is greater awareness of inequality And that’s a volatile mix for our democracies
And this is why addressing inequality has been one of the key areas of focus for my economic policy In our countries, in America and in most advanced market economies, we want people to be rewarded for their achievement We think that people should be rewarded if they come up with a new product or a new service that is popular and helps a lot of people But when a CEO of a company now makes more money in a single day than a typical worker does in an entire year, when it’s harder for workers to climb their way up the economic ladder, when they see a factory close that used to support an entire city or town, fuels the feeling that globalization only benefits those at the top And the reaction can drag down a country’s growth and make recessions more likely It can also lead to politics that create an unhealthy competition between countries Rather than a win-win situation, people perceive that if you’re winning, I’m losing, and barriers come up and walls come up
And in advanced economies, there are at times movements from both the left and the right to put a stop to integration, and to push back against technology, and to try to bring back jobs and industries that have been disappearing for decades So this impulse to pull back from a globalized world is understandable If people feel that they’re losing control of their future, they will push back We have seen it here in Greece We’ve seen it across Europe We’ve seen it in the United States We saw it in the vote in Britain to leave the EU
But given the nature of technology, it is my assertion that it’s not possible to cut ourselves off from one another We now are living in a global supply chain Our growth comes through innovation and ideas that are crossing borders all the time The jobs of tomorrow will inevitably be different from the jobs of the past So we can’t look backwards for answers, we have to look forward
We cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress and so much wealth For when competition for resources is perceived as zero-sum, we put ourselves on a path to conflict both within countries and between countries So I firmly believe that the best hope for human progress remains open markets combined with democracy and human rights But I have argued that the current path of globalization demands a course correction In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people, and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed
And we actually know the path to building more inclusive economies It’s just we too often don’t have the political will or desire to get it done We know we need bold policies that spur growth and support jobs We know that we need to give workers more leverage and better wages, and that, in fact, if you give workers better wages businesses do better, too, because their customers now have money to spend
We know that we have to invest more in our people -- the education of our young people, the skills and training to compete in the global economy We have to make sure that it is easy for young people who are eager to learn and eager to work to get the education that they need, the training that they need, without taking on huge amounts of debt
We know that we have to encourage entrepreneurship so that it’s easier to start a business and do business We know that we have to strengthen the social compact so that the safety net that is available for people, including quality health care and retirement benefits, are there even if people aren’t working in the same job for  years, or  years, or  years
We have to modernize our infrastructure, which will put people back to work We have to commit to the science and research and development that sparks new industries
In our trading relationships, we have to make sure that trade works for us, and not against us And that means insisting on high standards in all countries to support jobs, strong protections for workers, strong protections for the environment, so that even as we freely trade, people and workers in all countries see the benefits of trade in their own lives, not just benefits for the bottom line of large, multinational corporations
These are the kinds of policies, this is the work that I’ve pursued throughout my time as President Keep in mind I took office in the midst of the worst crisis since the Great Depression And we pursued a recovery that has been shared now by the vast majority of Americans We put people back to work building bridges and roads We passed tax cuts for the middle class We asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more taxes -- their fair share We intervened to save our auto industry, but insisted that the auto industry become more energy efficient, produce better cars that reduce pollution
We put in place policies to help students with loans and protect consumers from fraud We passed the strongest Wall Street reforms in history so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the global financial crisis never happen again -- or at least don’t start on Wall Street
And today, our businesses have created more than  million new jobs Incomes last year in America rose faster than any time since  Poverty fell at the fastest rate since  Inequality is being narrowed And we’ve also begun to close the pay gap between men and women
We declared that health care in America is a privilege not for the few, but a right for everybody Today our uninsured rate is at the lowest levels on record And we’ve done all this while doubling our production of clean energy, lowering our carbon pollution faster than any advanced nation So we’ve proven that you can grow the economy and reduce the carbon emissions that cause climate change at the same time
Now, I say all this not because we’ve solved every problem Our work is far from complete There are still too many people in America who are worried about their futures Still too many people who are working at wages that don’t get them above the poverty line Still too many young people who don’t see opportunity But the policies I describe point the direction for where we need to go in building inclusive economies And that’s how democracies can deliver the prosperity and hope that our people need And when people have opportunity and they feel confidence the future, they are less likely to turn on each other and they’re less likely to appeal to some of the darker forces that exist in all our societies -- those that can tear us apart
Here in Greece, you’re undergoing similar transformations The first step has been to build a foundation that allows you to return to robust economic growth And we don’t need to recount all the causes of the economic crisis here in Greece If we’re honest, we can acknowledge that it was a mix of both internal and external forces The Greek economy and the level of debt had become unsustainable And in this global economy, investment and jobs flow to countries where governments are efficient, not bloated, where the rules are clear To stay competitive, to attract investment that creates jobs, Greece had to start a reform process
Of course, the world, I don’t think, fully appreciates the extraordinary pain these reforms have involved, or the tremendous sacrifices that you, the Greek people, have made I’ve been aware of it, and I’ve been proud of all that my Administration has done to try to support Greece in these efforts And part of the purpose of my visit is to highlight for the world the important steps that have been taken here in Greece
Today, the budget is back in surplus Parliament passed reforms to make the economy more competitive Yes, there is still much more work to do I want to commend Prime Minister Tsipras for the very difficult reforms his government is pursuing to put the economy on a firmer footing Now, as Greece works to attract more investment, and to prevent old imbalances from re-emerging, and to put your economy on a stronger foundation, you’ll continue to have the full support of the United States
At the same time, I will continue to urge creditors to take the steps needed to put Greece on a path towards sustained economic recovery As Greece continues to implement reforms, the IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth They are right It is important because if reforms here are going to be sustained, people need to see hope, and they need to see progress And the young people who are in attendance here today and all across the country need to know there is a future -- there is an education and jobs that are worthy of your incredible potential You don’t have to travel overseas, you can put roots right here in your home, in Greece, and succeed
And I’m confident that if you stay the course, as hard as it has been, Greece will see brighter days Because, in this magnificent hall and center -- this symbol of the Greek culture and resilience -- we’re reminded that just as your strength and resolve have allowed you to overcome great odds throughout your history, nothing can break the spirit of the Greek people You will overcome this period of challenge just as you have other challenges in the past
So economics is something that will be central to preserving our democracies When our economies don’t work, our democracies become distorted and, in some cases, break down But this brings me to another pressing challenge that our democracies face -- how do we ensure that our diverse, multicultural, multiracial, multi-religious world and our diverse nations uphold both the rights of individuals and a fundamental civic adherence to a common creed that binds us together
Democracy is simplest where everybody thinks alike, looks alike, eats the same food, worships the same God Democracy becomes more difficult when there are people coming from a variety of backgrounds and trying to live together In our globalized world, with the migration of people and the rapid movement of ideas and cultures and traditions, we see increasingly this blend of forces mixing together in ways that often enrich our societies but also cause tensions
In the Information Age, the unprecedented exchange of information can always accentuate differences, or seem to threaten cherished ways of life It used to be that you might not know how people in another part of your country, or in the cities versus the countryside, were living Now everybody knows how everybody is living, and everybody can feel threatened sometimes if people don’t do things exactly the way they do things And they start asking themselves questions about their own identity And it can create a volatile politics
Faced with this new reality where cultures clash, it's inevitable that some will seek a comfort in nationalism or tribe or ethnicity or sect In countries that are held together by borders that were drawn by colonial powers, including many countries in the Middle East and in Africa, it can be tempting to fall back on perceived safety of enclaves and tribal divisions
In a world of widening inequality, there's a growing suspicion -- or even disdain -- for elites and institutions that seem remote from the daily lives of ordinary people What an irony it is, at a time when we can reach out to people in the most remote corners of the planet, so many citizens feel disconnected from their own governments
So, just as we have to have an inclusive economic strategy, we have to have an exclusive political and cultural strategy In all of our capitals, we have to keep making government more efficient, more effective in responding to the daily needs to citizens Governing institutions, whether in Athens, Brussels, London, Washington, have to be responsive to the concerns of citizens People have to know that they're being heard
Here in Europe, even with today's challenges, I believe that by virtue of the progress it has delivered over the decades -- the stability it has provided, the security it's reinforced -- that European integration and the European Union remains one of the great political and economic achievements of human history And today more than ever, the world needs a Europe that is strong and prosperous and democratic
But I think all institutions in Europe have to ask themselves: How can we make sure that people within individual countries feel as if their voices are still being heard, that their identities are being affirmed, that the decisions that are being made that will have a critical impact on their lives are not so remote that they have no ability to impact them?
We have to make clear that governments exist to serve the interest of citizens, and not the other way around And so this is why, as President of the United States, I've pursued initiatives like the Open Government Partnership that promotes transparency and accountability so that ordinary people know more about the decisions that affect their lives That's why both at home and around the world, we have taken steps to fight corruption that can rot a society from within
As authoritarian governments work to close space that citizens depend upon to organize and have their voices heard, we've begun the work of empowering civil society to defend democratic values and promote solutions to the problems within our communities And as so many people around the world sometimes are tempted by cynicism and not being involved because they think that politicians and government don’t care about them, we've created networks for young leaders and invested in young entrepreneurs, because we believe that the hope and renewal of our societies begins with the voices of youth
In closing, our globalized world is passing through a time of profound change Yes, there is uncertainty and there is unease, and none of us can know the future History does not move in a straight line Civil rights in America did not move in a straight line Democracy in Greece did not move in a straight line The evolution of a unified Europe certainly has not moved in a straight line And progress is never a guarantee Progress has to be earned by every generation But I believe history gives us hope
Twenty-five centuries after Athens first pointed the way,  years after the beginning of the great American journey, my faith and my confidence, my certainty in our democratic ideals and universal values remain undiminished I believe more strongly than ever that Dr King was right when he said that, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice” But it bends towards justice not because it is inevitable, but because we bend it towards justice; not because there are not going to be barriers to achieving justice, but because there will be people, generation after generation, who have the vision and the courage and the will to bend the arc of our lives in the direction of a better future
In the United States, and in every place I have visited these last eight years, I have met citizens, especially young people, who have chosen hope over fear, who believe that they can shape their own destiny, who refuse to accept the world as it is and are determined to remake it as it should be They have inspired me
In every corner of the world, I have met people who, in their daily lives, demonstrate that despite differences of race or religion or creed or color, we have the capacity to see each other in ourselves Like the woman here in Greece who said of the refugees arriving on these shores, "We live under the same sun We fall in love under the same moon We are all human -- we have to help these people" Women like that give me hope
In all of our communities, in all of our countries, I still believe there's more of what Greeks call philotimo -- love and respect and kindness for family and community and country, and a sense that we’re all in this together, with obligations to each other Philotimo -- I see it every day -- and that gives me hope
Because in the end, it is up to us It's not somebody else's job, it's not somebody else's responsibility, but it's the citizens of our countries and citizens of the world to bend that arc of history towards justice
And that’s what democracy allows us to do That's why the most important office in any country is not President or Prime Minister The most important title is “citizen” And in all of our nations, it will always be our citizens who decide the kind of countries we will be, the ideals that we will reach for, and the values that will define us In this great, imperfect, but necessary system of self-government, power and progress will always come from the demos -- from “We, the people” And I'm confident that as long as we are true to that system of self-government, that our futures will be bright
Thank you very much Zito e ellas 
 The quotation wad delivered during remarks before the ouse of Commons on  November : Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time; but there is the broad feeling in our country that the people should rule, continuously rule, and that public opinion, expressed by all constitutional means, should shape, guide, and control the actions of Ministers who are their servants and not their masters 


Hello, everybody Hello, hello
Hello, everybody In a couple hours, I’ll be departing on my final foreign trip as President And while we’re abroad, I’ll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait? I know that there’s a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas, and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them
Let me -- I know you still will That I'm aware, but I'm trying something out here First of all, let me mention three brief topics
First of all, as I discussed with the President-elect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel I remember what it was like when I came in eight years ago It is a big challenge This office is bigger than any one person And that’s why ensuring a smooth transition is so important
It’s not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy -- similar to norms of civility and tolerance, and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis It's part of what makes this country work And as long as I’m President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals
As I’ve told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys the car is in pretty good shape We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in eight years ago Jobs have been growing for  straight months Incomes are rising Poverty is falling The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth
And so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January st, America is in the strongest position possible and hopefully there’s an opportunity for the next President to build on that
Number two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy And because there is one President at a time, I’ll spend this week reinforcing America’s support for the approaches that we’ve taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues
I look forward to my first visit in Greece And then, in Germany, I’ll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who’s probably been my closest international partner these past eight years I’ll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies, and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe It’s essential to our national security and it's essential to global stability And that’s why the Transatlantic Alliance and the NATO Alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican Administrations
Finally, in Peru, I’ll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia Pacific This is a time of great change in the world But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe And that’s what it must continue to be
Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill’s family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing Gwen was a friend of ours She was an extraordinary journalist She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession -- asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work
I always appreciated Gwen’s reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator’s table or at the anchor desk, she not only informed today’s citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow’s journalists She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect -- and for whom she blazed a trail as one-half of the first all-female anchor team on network news
So Gwen did her country a great service Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today
So, with that, I'm going to take some questions And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal
My understanding is, Colleen, that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City
Question: Correct
President Obama: Josh just happens to be from Kansas City So I didn’t know if there was any coincidence there But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors
Question: As it turns out, there’s no place like Kansas City
President Obama: There you go
Question: You're about to embark on your final foreign trip What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They’ve expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump Should they be worried about the future of US foreign policy? And secondly, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?
President Obama: One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander-in-Chief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President, it is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries, and our diplomats and other diplomats, and intelligence officers and development workers And there's enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world That will continue
In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world
With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated and it's hard and it's challenging And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing
The Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles; The belief that we should an economy that works for everybody, not just a few The belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive That we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or what zip code they were born in That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn’t just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values
So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn’t be up for debate, should be our North Star But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about I believe that we have better ideas But I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere We have to show up everywhere We have to work at a grassroots level -- something that's been a running thread in my career
I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent  days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by  points instead of  points There are some counties maybe I won that people didn’t expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for
And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press story It’s increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press
And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up state parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you’re paying attention to, and state rep races and city council races -- that all I think will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future
And I’m optimistic that will happen For Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I’ve been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in ; they may not remember me showing up here in  when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally Republicans controlled the Senate and the House And two years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and four years later, I was President of the United States
Things change pretty rapidly But they don’t change inevitably They change because you work for it Nobody said democracy was supposed to be easy This is hard And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard
Mark Knoller
Question: Thank you, sir
President Obama: Good to see you
Question: Thank you Good to see you Mr President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President? Can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens? And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump?
President Obama: About a week ago I started feeling pretty good No, look, I think the learning curve always continues This is a remarkable job It is like no other job on Earth And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world
If you were President  years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis Today, they’re seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today it does
So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any Administration has to deal with today -- and respond to much more rapidly than ever before -- that makes it different I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about two weeks before anybody reported on it Imagine that I think it’s fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they’ve got to figure out in about an hour what their response is
So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation I hope it was I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff -- particularly your chief of staff, your national security advisor, your White House counsel -- how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that ultimately the President is going to be the final decision-maker, that that’s something that has to be attended to right away
I have been blessed by having -- and I admittedly am biased -- some of the smartest, hardest-working, good people in my Administration that I think any President has ever had And as a consequence of that team, I’ve been able to make good decisions And if you don’t have that around you, then you’ll get swamped So I hope that he appreciated that advice
What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election -- all those things are important and should be thought about And I think it’s important to give him the room and the space to do that It takes time to put that together
But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he’s actually taken office
Question: And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job?
President Obama: Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you’ll recall we were losing about , jobs a month
So the good news is that in some ways my experience is atypical It’s hard to find an analogous situation By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years We were in the midst of a free fall The financial system was locking up The auto industry was about to go belly up The housing market had entirely collapsed So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job We just had to make a bunch of decisions
In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected -- otherwise, we wouldn’t have had the results that we had in the election On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in eight, nine years Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two We've got historically low uninsured rates The financial systems are stable The stock market is hovering around its all-time high, and s have been restored The housing market has recovered
We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us Our alliances are in strong shape The progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth And gas is two bucks a gallon
So he will have time and space I think to make judicious decisions The incoming Administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years I’m very proud of them for it
Athena Jones
Question: Thank you, Mr President You said more than once that you do not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?
And if I can do a compound question, the other one is you mentioned staffing and tone What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor What message does that send to the country, to the world?
President Obama: Athena, without copping out, I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition
Look, the people have spoken Donald Trump will be the next President, the th President of the United States And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies And those who didn’t vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works That's how this system operates
When I won, there were a number of people who didn’t like me and didn’t like what I stood for And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality Hopefully it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts And so I don’t know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having  percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote But it makes a difference
So given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him, and members of Congress, and reaching out to constituencies that didn’t vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see, and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in
And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made
And my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing I think he recognizes that I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward And I don’t think any President ever comes in saying to themselves, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that
But it's only been six days And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t translate into good policy And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with
I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns, and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign And I think that's something that he will want to do But this is all happening real fast He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that
Question: And your view of his qualifications Has that changed after meeting with him?
President Obama: I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win -- he has won He's going to be the next President And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don’t match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself
And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history -- those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people
Scott Horsley
Question: Thank you, Mr President You’re off to Europe, which is facing some of the same populous pressures we see at work in this country When you spoke at the UN, you talked about the choice we're facing between integration and building walls What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices?
President Obama: I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it’s interconnected, that you’re not going to put that genie back in the bottle The American people recognize that their careers, or their kids’ careers are going to have to be more dynamic -- that they might not be working at a single plant for  years, but they might have to change careers They might have to get more education They might have to retool or retrain
And I think the American people are game for that They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans’ attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade But they’re concerned about whether or not trade is fair, and whether we’ve got the same access to other countries’ markets as they have with us; is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, and so forth
Now, I made an argument -- thus far, unsuccessfully -- that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that, that it strengthened workers’ rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field and, as a consequences, would be good for American workers and American businesses But that’s a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored
So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair -- I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign
As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy It keeps this country young It keeps it dynamic We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks And that’s part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful It’s part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we got a younger population that’s more dynamic
When it comes to trade, I think when you’re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you’ve got a global supply chain The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they’re bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico And so it’s not as simple as it might have seemed
And the key for us -- when I say “us,” I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives -- is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real; here’s how we fix them: Higher minimum wage Stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie Stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones Yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren’t engaging in child labor, for example Being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks that are in communities that feel forgotten
That’s going to be our most important strategy And I think we can successfully do that People will still be looking to the United States Our example will still carry great weight And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past
Martha Raddatz
Question: Thanks, Mr President We heard some of the harsh words you had about Mr Trump, calling him “temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief” Did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump presidency?
President Obama: Well, we had a very cordial conversation And that didn't surprise me to some degree because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person He’s somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate
And what’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxiety, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff
I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with I don't think he is ideological I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way And that can serve him well, as long as he’s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction
Do I have concerns? Absolutely Of course, I’ve got concerns He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it’s an ocean liner -- as I discovered when I came into office It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes -- even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr Trump will enjoy when he comes into office
And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he’s really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out I’ll use an obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act
So obviously this has been the Holy Grail for Republicans over the last six, seven years -- was “we've got to kill Obamacare” Now, that has been taken as an article of faith -- that this is terrible, it doesn’t work and we have to undo it
But now that Republicans are in charge, they got to take a look and say, let's see, we got  million people who have health insurance who didn’t have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefitting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of -- everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms
Now, it's one thing to characterize this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction Now, suddenly, you're in charge and you're going to repeal it Okay, well, what happens to those  million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off and suddenly they don’t have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job, and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they're ? How are you going to approach all these issues?
Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that  million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first one to say, that's great -- congratulations
If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage, and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way
So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is now comes the hard part Now is governance We are going to be able to present to the incoming Administration a country that is stronger, a federal government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs
And I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick And if things get better, then more power to him And I'll be the first to congratulate him
Question: Mr President, you had talked specifically about his temperament Do you still have any concern about his temperament?
President Obama: As I said -- because, Athena asked the question -- whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully then you correct for it
This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper I am not well organized in that way And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system because I have bad filing, sorting and organizing habits And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff That seems trivial, but actually it ends up being a pretty big piece of business
I think what will happen with the President-elect is there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States Everybody around the world is paying attention Markets move National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes And I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people
All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions and then I get out of here
Nadia Bilbassy
Question: Thank you, Mr President President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal that your Administration worked very hard to get What would be a concern if he alters part of it? And what would your advice be, considering that he said he’s open to advice?
And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with massive destruction You spoke passionately a few years back about Benghazi and you warned against the killing of civilians there Many people criticized your Administration for the shortcoming of the Syria policy Are you willing to admit any fault under your watch? And how do you act with President-elect Trump says that he won't support the Syrian opposition? Thank you
President Obama: Iran is a good example of the gap I think between some of the rhetoric in this town -- not unique to the President-elect -- and the reality I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that It was a serious debate I think people of goodwill were on both sides of the issue Ultimately, we were able to persuade members of Congress and the public -- at least enough of them -- to support it
At the time, the main argument against it was Iran wouldn’t abide by the deal, that they would cheat We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement That's not just my opinion, it's not just people in my Administration That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a government that vehemently opposed the deal
So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he’s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain -- particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon
And keep in mind this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P+, other countries, some of our closest allies And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do
So it becomes more difficult I think to undo something that’s working than undo something that isn’t working And when you’re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts
That is going to be true in other circumstances For example, the Paris agreement There’s been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement Now, you’ve got  countries that have signed up to this thing And the good news is that what we’ve been able to show over the last five, six, eight years is that it’s possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well
It’s not just a bunch of rules that we’ve set up You’ve got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs You’ve got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it’s good for the environment
You’ve got states like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any federal regulations that have been put forward In fact,  percent of the country already lives under -- in states that are actively pursuing what’s embodied in the Paris agreement and the Clean Power Plan rule And even states like Texas that politically tend to oppose me -- you’ve seen huge increases in wind power and solar power And you’ve got some of the country’s biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it’s good for their bottom line
So what we’ve been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works And it’s made our economy more efficient, it’s helped the bottom line of folks, and it’s cleaned up the environment
What the Paris agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let’s work together so you guys do the same thing
And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn’t going to come from us -- because we only have  million people It’s going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off
And so, again, do I think that the new Administration will make some changes? Absolutely But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across Administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us
Last question Justin Sink
Question: Sir, on Syria
President Obama: I’m sorry, I’m sorry Okay, you’re right You are right about that
With respect to Syria -- in Benghazi, we had an international mandate We had a UN Security resolution We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly It’s no secret -- you know this region well -- that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction
And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there But if what you’re asking is do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different We don’t have that option easily available to us
And so we’re going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can on the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and ceasefires that at least alleviate the suffering that’s on the ground
I recognize that that has not worked And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end But I think it’s not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now have substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa -- that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya
And obviously there are some who question the steps we took in Libya I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there and now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place
I’ve given you -- last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg
Question: Thanks, Mr President I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump Administration One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the federal government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program I’m wondering if there’s anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump Administration, considering his stance on immigration
And the second is, the Administration and you have long maintained that the legal constraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander-in-Chief Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump Administration, is this now the time to sort of test that theory by moving the detainees and see where the chips will lie?
President Obama: Those are both excellent questions On the deferred action program that we have known as DACA that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefitting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming Administration to think long and hard before they are endangering that status of what for all practical purposes are American kids
These are kids who were brought here by their parents They did nothing wrong They've gone to school They have pledged allegiance to the flag Some of them have joined the military They've enrolled in school By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at
With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population You now have significantly less than a hundred people there There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next two months
There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States But because of the nature of the evidence, in some cases, that evidence being compromised, it’s very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by US jurisdiction We’d do it a lot cheaper and just as safely
Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does, as well We will continue to explore options for doing that But keep in mind that it’s not just a matter of what I’m willing to do One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you got to pay attention to them And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President
I am very proud of the fact that we will -- knock on wood -- leave this Administration without significant scandal We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this Administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms, and keeping trust with the American people -- I will put this Administration against any Administration in history
And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers And we had a strong White House Counsel’s Office We had a strong Ethics Office We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it’s supposed to -- because we got  million people working in the federal government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could And that takes a lot of work
And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously, as well Again, you wouldn’t know this if you were listening to some news outlets, or some members of oversight committees in Congress But if you actually look at the facts, it works
And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the federal government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing You look at VA People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix It was scandalous what happened What people don’t remember is, is that we’ve brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren’t getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half Just made the agency work better -- not work perfect, but work better
And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good Perfect is unattainable Better is possible
And so we will try to share the lessons that we’ve learned over these last eight years with the incoming President And my hope is he makes things better And if he does, we’ll all benefit from it
All right? Thank you, everybody You guys, some of you who are traveling, you’ll get a chance to ask more questions All right?
Thank you

Well, I just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with President-elect Trump It was wide-ranging We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House We talked about foreign policy We talked about domestic policy And as I said last night, my number-one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our President-elect is successful
And I have been very encouraged by the, I think, interest in President -- President-elect Trump's wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face
And in the meantime, Michelle has had a chance to greet the incoming First Lady And we had an excellent conversation with her as well, and we want to make sure that they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition
And most of all, I want to emphasize to you, Mr President-elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed -- because if you succeed, then the country succeeds
Please, Mr Trump
President-Elect Trump: Well, thank you very much, President Obama This was a meeting that was going to last for maybe  or  minutes, and we were just going to get to know each other We had never met each other I have great respect The meeting lasted for almost an hour and a half And it could have -- as far as I'm concerned, it could -- could have gone on for a lot longer
We really -- We discussed a lot of different situations, some wonderful and some difficulties I very much look forward to dealing with the President in the future, including counsel He's -- He explained some of the difficulties, some of the -- the high-flying assets and some of the -- some of the really great things that have been achieved
So, Mr President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward to being with you many, many more times in the future
President Obama: Sure All right
President-Elect Trump: Thank you, sir


Good afternoon, everybody
Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning
And that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true The sun is up And I know everybody had a long night I did as well I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night about : in the morning, I think it was, to congratulate him on winning the election And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies
Now, it is no secret that the president-elect and I have some pretty significant differences But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running
And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect -- because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world
I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had a chance to hear her remarks I could not be prouder of her She has lived an extraordinary life of public service She was a great First Lady She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York And she could not have been a better secretary of state
I'm proud of her A lot of Americans look up to her Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world
Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team This is an "intramural scrimmage" We're not Democrats first We're not Republicans first We are Americans first We're patriots first
We all what -- want what's best for this country That's what I heard in Mr Trump's remarks last night That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly And I was heartened by that That's what the country needs -- a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin
I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done, day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of -- a lot of attention -- work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better, and make it more responsive, and make it more efficient, and make it more service-friendly so that it's actually helping more people That remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago
So win or lose in this election, that was always our mission That was our mission from day one And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done; and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools, doctors in ER clinic, small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well, all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every state, the work of perfecting this union
So this was a long and hard fought campaign A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today; a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns That's the nature of democracy It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring
But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged Don't get cynical Don't ever think you can't make a difference As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it Sometimes you lose an argument; sometimes you lose an election
You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line We zig and zag and sometimes, you know, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's okay I've lost elections before Joe hasn't, but, you know -- So I've been -- I've been sort of sharing --
Vice President Biden: I remember you beat me badly
President Obama: That's the way politics works sometimes We -- We try really hard to persuade people that we're right and then people vote And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes We do some reflection We lick our wounds We brush ourselves off We get back in the arena We go at it We try even harder the next time
The point, though, is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy That's how this country has moved forward for  years It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens It's how we have come this far
And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that
I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner You take the baton You run your best race And hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team
All right? Thank you very much, everybody

Zvia, Yoni, Chemi and generations of the Peres family; President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; members of the Israeli government and the Knesset; heads of state and the government and guests from around the world, including President Abbas, whose presence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace; to the people of Israel: I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea
A free life, in a homeland regained A secure life, in a nation that can defend itself, by itself A full life, in friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always A bountiful life, driven by simple pleasures of family and by big dreams This was Shimon Peres's life This is the State of Israel This is the story of the Jewish people over the last century, and it was made possible by a founding generation that counts Shimon as one of its own
Shimon once said, “The message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and moral vision can triumph over all adversity” For Shimon, that moral vision was rooted in an honest reckoning of the world as it is Born in the shtetl, he said he felt, “surrounded by a sea of thick and threatening forests” When his family got the chance to go to Palestine, his beloved grandfather’s parting words were simple: “Shimon, stay a Jew” Propelled with that faith, he found his home He found his purpose He found his life’s work But he was still a teenager when his grandfather was burned alive by the Nazis in the town where Shimon was born The synagogue in which he prayed became an inferno The railroad tracks that had carried him toward the Promised Land also delivered so many of his people to death camps
And so from an early age, Shimon bore witness to the cruelty that human beings could inflict on each other, the ways that one group of people could dehumanize another; the particular madness of anti-Semitism, which has run like a stain through history That understanding of man’s ever-present sinfulness would steel him against hardship and make him vigilant against threats to Jewry around the world
But that understanding would never harden his heart It would never extinguish his faith Instead, it broadened his moral imagination, and gave him the capacity to see all people as deserving of dignity and respect It helped him see not just the world as it is, but the world as it should be
What Shimon did to shape the story of Israel is well-chronicled Starting on the kibbutz he founded with his love Sonya, he began the work of building a model community Ben Gurion called him to serve the Haganah at headquarters to make sure that the Jewish people had the armaments and the organization to secure their freedom After independence, surrounded by enemies who denied Israel’s existence and sought to drive it into the sea, the child who had wanted to be a “poet of stars” became a man who built Israel’s defense industry, who laid the foundation for the formidable armed forces that won Israel’s wars His skill secured Israel’s strategic position His boldness sent Israeli commandos to Entebbe, and rescued Jews from Ethiopia His statesmanship built an unbreakable bond with the United States of America and so many other countries
His contributions didn't end there Shimon also showed what people can do when they harness reason and science to a common cause He understood that a country without many natural resources could more than make up for it with the talents of its people He made hard choices to roll back inflation and climb up from a terrible economic crisis He championed the promise of science and technology to make the desert bloom, and turned this tiny country into a central hub of the digital age, making life better not just for people here, but for people around the world
Indeed, Shimon’s contribution to this nation is so fundamental, so pervasive, that perhaps sometimes they can be overlooked For a younger generation, Shimon was probably remembered more for a peace process that never reached its endpoint They would listen to critics on the left who might argue that Shimon did not fully acknowledge the failings of his nation, or perhaps more numerous critics on the right who argued that he refused to see the true wickedness of the world, and called him naïve
But whatever he shared with his family or his closest friends, to the world he brushed off the critics And I know from my conversations with him that his pursuit of peace was never naïve Every Yom HaShoah, he read the names of the family that he lost As a young man, he had fed his village by working in the fields during the day, but then defending it by carrying a rifle at night He understood, in this war-torn region, where too often Arab youth are taught to hate Israel from an early age -- he understood just how hard peace would be I'm sure he was alternatively angry and bemused to hear the same critics, who called him hopelessly naïve, depend on the defense architecture that he himself had helped to build
I don’t believe he was naïve But he understood from hard-earned experience that true security comes through making peace with your neighbors “We won them all,” he said of Israel’s wars “But we did not win the greatest victory that we aspired to: release from the need to win victories”
And just as he understood the practical necessity of peace, Shimon believed that Israel’s exceptionalism was rooted not only in fidelity to the Jewish people, but to the moral and ethical vision, the precepts of his Jewish faith “The Jewish people weren’t born to rule another people,” he would say “From the very first day we are against slaves and masters”
Out of the hardships of the diaspora, he found room in his heart for others who suffered He came to hate prejudice with the passion of one who knows how it feels to be its target Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, he insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews, and must therefore be equal in self-determination Because of his sense of justice, his analysis of Israel’s security, his understanding of Israel’s meaning, he believed that the Zionist idea would be best protected when Palestinians, too, had a state of their own
Of course, we gather here in the knowledge that Shimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled The region is going through a chaotic time Threats are ever present And yet, he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working By the time that I came to work with Shimon, he was in the twilight of his years -- although he might not admit it I would be the th US President since John F Kennedy to sit down with Shimon; the th to fall prey to his charms
I think of him sitting in the Oval Office, this final member of Israel’s founding generation, under the portrait of George Washington, telling me stories from the past, but more often talking with enthusiasm of the present -- his most recent lecture, his next project, his plans for the future, the wonders of his grandchildren
In many ways, he reminded me of some other giants of the th century that I’ve had the honor to meet -- men like Nelson Mandela; women like Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth -- leaders who have seen so much, whose lives span such momentous epochs, that they find no need to posture or traffic in what’s popular in the moment; people who speak with depth and knowledge, not in sound bites They find no interest in polls or fads
And like these leaders, Shimon could be true to his convictions even if they cut against the grain of current opinion He knew, better than the cynic, that if you look out over the arc of history, human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope I'm sure that's why he was so excited about technology -- because for him, it symbolized the march of human progress And it’s why he loved so much to talk about young people -- because he saw young people unburdened by the prejudices of the past It’s why he believed in miracles -- because in Israel, he saw a miracle come true
As Americans and Israelis, we often talk about the unbreakable bonds between our nations And, yes, these bonds encompass common interests -- vital cooperation that makes both our nations more secure But today we are reminded that the bonds which matter most run deeper Anchored in a Judeo-Christian tradition, we believe in the irreducible value of every human being Our nations were built on that idea They were built in large part by stubborn idealists and striving immigrants, including those who had fled war and fled oppression Both our nations have flaws that we have not always fixed, corners of our history which date back to our founding that we do not always squarely address But because our founders planted not just flags in the eternal soil, but also planted the seeds of democracy, we have the ability to always pursue a better world We have the capacity to do what is right
As an American, as a Christian, a person partly of African descent, born in Hawaii -- a place that could not be further than where Shimon spent his youth -- I took great pleasure in my friendship with this older, wiser man We shared a love of words and books and history And perhaps, like most politicians, we shared too great a joy in hearing ourselves talk But beyond that, I think our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine Because for all of our differences, both of us had lived such unlikely lives It was so surprising to see the two of us where we had started, talking together in the White House, meeting here in Israel And I think both of us understood that we were here only because in some way we reflected the magnificent story of our nations
Shimon’s story, the story of Israel, the experience of the Jewish people, I believe it is universal It’s the story of a people who, over so many centuries in the wilderness, never gave up on that basic human longing to return home It’s the story of a people who suffered the boot of oppression and the shutting of the gas chamber’s door, and yet never gave up on a belief in goodness And it’s the story of a man who was counted on, and then often counted out, again and again, and who never lost hope
Shimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel, like the United States of America, was not built by cynics We exist because people before us refused to be constrained by the past or the difficulties of the present And Shimon Peres was never cynical It is that faith, that optimism, that belief -- even when all the evidence is to the contrary -- that tomorrow can be better, that makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him
The last of the founding generation is now gone Shimon accomplished enough things in his life for a thousand men But he understood that it is better to live to the very end of his time on Earth with a longing not for the past but for the dreams that have not yet come true -- an Israel that is secure in a just and lasting peace with its neighbors And so now this work is in the hand of Israel’s next generation, in the hands of Israel's next generation and its friends
Like Joshua, we feel the weight of responsibility that Shimon seemed to wear so lightly But we draw strength from his example and the fact that he believed in us -- even when we doubted ourselves
Scripture tells us that before his death, Moses said:
I call upon heaven and earth to bear witness this day that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live
Uvacharta Bachayim Choose life For Shimon, let us choose life, as he always did Let us make his work our own May God bless his memory And may God bless this country, and this world, that he loved so dearly
Shimon: Todah Rabah Chaver Yakar
 "Thank you very much, dear friend"

James Baldwin once wrote, For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard” For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard
Today, as so many generations have before, we gather on our National Mall to tell an essential part of our American story -- one that has at times been overlooked -- we come not just for today, but for all time
President and Mrs Bush; President Clinton; Vice President and Dr Biden; Chief Justice Roberts; Secretary Skorton; Reverend Butts; distinguished guests: Thank you Thank you for your leadership in making sure this tale is told We’re here in part because of you and because of all those Americans -- the Civil War vets, the Civil Rights foot soldiers, the champions of this effort on Capitol Hill -- who, for more than a century, kept the dream of this museum alive
That includes our leaders in Congress -- Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi It includes one of my heroes, John Lewis, who, as he has so often, took the torch from those who came before him and brought us past the finish line It includes the philanthropists and benefactors and advisory members who have so generously given not only their money but their time It includes the Americans who offered up all the family keepsakes tucked away in Grandma’s attic And of course, it includes a man without whose vision and passion and persistence we would not be here today -- Mr Lonnie Bunch
What we can see of this building -- the towering glass, the artistry of the metalwork -- is surely a sight to behold But beyond the majesty of the building, what makes this occasion so special is the larger story it contains Below us, this building reaches down  feet, its roots spreading far wider and deeper than any tree on this Mall And on its lowest level, after you walk past remnants of a slave ship, after you reflect on the immortal declaration that “all men are created equal,” you can see a block of stone On top of this stone sits a historical marker, weathered by the ages That marker reads: “General Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay spoke from this slave block…during the year ”
I want you to think about this Consider what this artifact tells us about history, about how it’s told, and about what can be cast aside On a stone where day after day, for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle; on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet -- for a long time, the only thing we considered important, the singular thing we once chose to commemorate as “history” with a plaque were the unmemorable speeches of two powerful men
And that block I think explains why this museum is so necessary Because that same object, reframed, put in context, tells us so much more As Americans, we rightfully passed on the tales of the giants who built this country; who led armies into battle and waged seminal debates in the halls of Congress and the corridors of power But too often, we ignored or forgot the stories of millions upon millions of others, who built this nation just as surely, whose humble eloquence, whose calloused hands, whose steady drive helped to create cities, erect industries, build the arsenals of democracy
And so this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are It helps us better understand the lives, yes, of the President, but also the slave; the industrialist, but also the porter; the keeper of the status quo, but also of the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo; the teacher or the cook, alongside the statesman And by knowing this other story, we better understand ourselves and each other It binds us together It reaffirms that all of us are America -- that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story, it's not the underside of the American story, it is central to the American story That our glory derives not just from our most obvious triumphs, but how we’ve wrested triumph from tragedy, and how we've been able to remake ourselves, again and again and again, in accordance with our highest ideals
I, too, am America
The great historian John Hope Franklin, who helped to get this museum started, once said, “Good history is a good foundation for a better present and future” He understood the best history doesn’t just sit behind a glass case; it helps us to understand what’s outside the case The best history helps us recognize the mistakes that we’ve made and the dark corners of the human spirit that we need to guard against And, yes, a clear-eyed view of history can make us uncomfortable, and shake us out of familiar narratives But it is precisely because of that discomfort that we learn and grow and harness our collective power to make this nation more perfect
That’s the American story that this museum tells -- one of suffering and delight; one of fear but also of hope; of wandering in the wilderness and then seeing out on the horizon a glimmer of the Promised Land
It is in this embrace of truth, as best as we can know it, in the celebration of the entire American experience, where real patriotism lies As President Bush just said, a great nation doesn’t shy from the truth It strengthens us It emboldens us It should fortify us It is an act of patriotism to understand where we've been And this museum tells the story of so many patriots
Yes, African Americans have felt the cold weight of shackles and the stinging lash of the field whip But we’ve also dared to run north, and sing songs from Harriet Tubman’s hymnal We’ve buttoned up our Union Blues to join the fight for our freedom We’ve railed against injustice for decade upon decade -- a lifetime of struggle, and progress, and enlightenment that we see etched in Frederick Douglass’s mighty, leonine gaze
Yes, this museum tells a story of people who felt the indignity, the small and large humiliations of a “whites only” sign, or wept at the side of Emmett Till’s coffin, or fell to their knees on shards of stained glass outside a church where four little girls died But it also tells the story of the black youth and white youth sitting alongside each other, straight-backed, so full of dignity on those lunch counter stools; the story of a six-year-old Ruby Bridges, pigtails, fresh-pressed dress, walking that gauntlet to get to school; Tuskegee airmen soaring the skies not just to beat a dictator, but to reaffirm the promise of our democracy -- but remind us that all of us are created equal
This is the place to understand how protest and love of country don’t merely coexist but inform each other; how men can proudly win the gold for their country but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist; how we can wear “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt and still grieve for fallen police officers Here’s the America where the razor-sharp uniform of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff belongs alongside the cape of the Godfather of Soul We have shown the world that we can float like butterflies and sting like bees; that we can rocket into space like Mae Jemison, steal home like Jackie, rock like Jimi, stir the pot like Richard Pryor; or we can be sick and tired of being sick and tired, like Fannie Lou Hamer, and still Rock Steady like Aretha Franklin
We are large, Walt Whitman told us, containing multitudes We are large, containing multitudes Full of contradictions That's America That's what makes us grow That's what makes us extraordinary And as is true for America, so is true for African American experience We're not a burden on America, or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America We're America
And that's what this museum explains -- the fact that our stories have shaped every corner of our culture The struggles for freedom that took place made our Constitution a real and living document, tested and shaped and deepened and made more profound its meaning for all people The story told here doesn’t just belong to black Americans; it belongs to all Americans -- for the African-American experience has been shaped just as much by Europeans and Asians and Native Americans and Latinos We have informed each other We are polyglot, a stew
Scripture promised that if we lift up the oppressed, then our light will rise in the darkness, and our night will become like the noonday And the story contained in this museum makes those words prophecy And that’s what this day is about That’s what this museum is about I, too, am America It is a glorious story, the one that's told here It is complicated and it is messy and it is full of contradictions, as all great stories are, as Shakespeare is, as Scripture is And it’s a story that perhaps needs to be told now more than ever
A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city or every rural hamlet It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind It won't wipe away every instance of discrimination in a job interview or a sentencing hearing or folks trying to rent an apartment Those things are up to us, the decisions and choices we make It requires speaking out, and organizing, and voting, until our values are fully reflected in our laws and our policies and our communities
But what this museum does show us is that in even the face of oppression, even in the face of unimaginable difficulty, America has moved forward And so this museum provides context for the debates of our times It illuminates them and gives us some sense of how they evolved, and perhaps keeps them in proportion Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Tulsa and Charlotte But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past but, within the white communities across this nation we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand, and are trying to do the right thing
It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history, it's just a blink in the eye of history It was just yesterday And so we should not be surprised that not all the healing is done We shouldn’t despair that it’s not all solved And knowing the larger story should instead remind us of just how remarkable the changes that have taken place truly are -- just in my lifetime -- and thereby inspire us to further progress
And so hopefully this museum can help us talk to each other And more importantly, listen to each other And most importantly, see each other Black and white and Latino and Native American and Asian American -- see how our stories are bound together And bound together with women in America, and workers in America, and entrepreneurs in America, and LGBT Americans And for young people who didn’t live through the struggles represented here, I hope you draw strength from the changes that have taken place Come here and see the power of your own agency See how young John Lewis was These were children who transformed a nation in a blink of an eye Young people, come here and see your ability to make your mark
The very fact of this day does not prove that America is perfect, but it does validate the ideas of our founding, that this country born of change, this country born of revolution, this country of we, the people, this country can get better
And that’s why we celebrate, mindful that our work is not yet done; mindful that we are but on a waystation on this common journey towards freedom And how glorious it is that we enshrine it here, on some of our nation’s most hallowed ground -- the same place where lives were once traded but also where hundreds of thousands of Americans, of all colors and creeds, once marched How joyful it is that this story take its rightful place -- alongside Jefferson who declared our independence, and Washington who made it real, and alongside Lincoln who saved our union, and the GIs who defended it; alongside a new monument to a King, gazing outward, summoning us toward that mountaintop How righteous it is that with tell this story here
For almost eight years, I have been blessed with the extraordinary honor of serving you in this office Time and again, I’ve flown low over this mall on Marine One, often with Michelle and our daughters And President Clinton, President Bush, they’ll tell you it is incredible sight We pass right across the Washington Monument -- it feels like you can reach out and touch it And at night, if you turn the other way, you don't just see the Lincoln Memorial, Old Abe is lit up and you can see him, his spirit glowing from that building And we don’t have many trips left But over the years, I’ve always been comforted as I’ve watched this museum rise from this earth into this remarkable tribute Because I know that years from now, like all of you, Michelle and I will be able to come here to this museum, and not just bring our kids but hopefully our grandkids I imagine holding a little hand of somebody and tell them the stories that are enshrined here
And in the years that follow, they’ll be able to do the same And then we’ll go to the Lincoln Memorial and we'll take in the view atop the Washington Monument And together, we’ll learn about ourselves, as Americans -- our sufferings, our delights, and our triumphs And we’ll walk away better for it, better because the better grasp of history We'll walk away that much more in love with this country, the only place on Earth where this story could have unfolded
It is a monument, no less than the others on this Mall, to the deep and abiding love for this country, and the ideals upon which it is founded For we, too, are America
So enough talk President Bush is timing me He had the overunder at  Let us now open this museum to the world Today, we have with us a family that reflects the arc of our progress: the Bonner family -- four generations in all, starting with gorgeous seven-year-old Christine and going up to gorgeous -year-old Ruth
Now, Ruth’s father, Elijah Odom, was born into servitude in Mississippi He was born a slave As a young boy, he ran, though, to his freedom He lived through Reconstruction and he lived through Jim Crow But he went on to farm, and graduate from medical school, and gave life to the beautiful family that we see today -- with a spirit reflected in beautiful Christine, free and equal in the laws of her country and in the eyes of God
So in a brief moment, their family will join us in ringing a bell from the First Baptist Church in Virginia -- one of the oldest black churches in America, founded under a grove of trees in  And the sound of this bell will be echoed by others in houses of worship and town squares all across this country -- an echo of the ringing bells that signaled Emancipation more than a century and a half ago; the sound, and the anthem, of American freedom
God bless you all God bless the United States of America


Mr President; Mr Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and gentlemen: As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years
From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest warm, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change
This is important work It has made a real difference in the lives of our people And it could not have happened had we not worked together And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order
We see it in the headlines every day Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law
This is the paradox that defines our world today A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface
And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion
I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not backward I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts -- facts that all too often, we forget in the immediacy of current events
Here’s the most important fact: The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children Over the last  years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly  percent of humanity to under  percent That's unprecedented And it's not an abstraction It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth
Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history
Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last  years
In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth
I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest complacency Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress
In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle transnational challenges
And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism -- sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right -- which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination
We cannot dismiss these visions They are powerful They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications -- together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain -- makes it self-defeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself
So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions -- economic, political, and cultural -- that are caused by integration are squarely addressed This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together
It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers
In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable -- nearly  trillion dollars stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight
A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other  percent will never be stable I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine people’s faith in the system
So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box Nor can we look to failed models of the past If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation -- these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end
But I do believe there’s another path -- one that fuels growth and innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is broadly based And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage It means investing in our people -- their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks -- to look for a new job, or start a new venture
These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States, and with clear results American businesses have created now  million new jobs After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than  percent of income growth But today, that's down to about half Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly  years And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress will continue
So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism -- not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation -- because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe That’s why we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we've done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared
And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe This is difficult politically It's difficult to spend on foreign assistance But I do not believe this is charity For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do
And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair The Paris Agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force, and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy
So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be the beginning We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries And only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair
So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable And in the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people
I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance I do not think that America can -- or should -- impose our system of government on other countries But there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest I believe in a liberal political order -- an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law
I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave It turns out building accountable institutions is hard work -- the work of generations The gains are often fragile Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong, democratic institutions
But I believe this thinking is wrong I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path I believe that in the st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up -- because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs to check the abuses of power Without this evolution, ultimately expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set in And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths -- permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war
Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story Our nation began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few But because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest, and ultimately, those ideals won out -- opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States
So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America Look at the transformation that's taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia, Botswana The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake
In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own
So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens -- not less
Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics Too often, in capitals, decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down And so these are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at home
Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply held beliefs of its people So I recognize a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea -- the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives I believe that spirit is universal And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity, and the opportunity to control their own lives
This leads me to the third thing we need to do: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings
It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force Asian powers debate competing claims of history And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries
Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions -- from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking
We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated These forces built up for years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL
The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and bloodletting, and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy
And there is a military component to that It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect
Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder Because until basic questions are answered about how communities co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer -- most of all in that region -- but extremism will continue to be exported overseas And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies
And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance Surely, we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities -- whether it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or a racial minority right here in the United States And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others
And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations
As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington -- and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well But I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last  years -- and I’ve acknowledged some -- we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good
We have secured allies We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable We supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions We’ve bound our power to international laws and institutions When we've made mistakes, we've tried to acknowledge them We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders
I'm proud of that But I also know that we can't do this alone And I believe that if we're to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them
When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that enhances global security and enhances Iran's ability to work with other nations On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test them again
We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders -- mosquitoes don't respect walls -- unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola -- by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure
We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children -- including our girls -- the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world But we have to put our money where our mouths are
And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding -- to replace the ravages of war with cooperation -- if powerful nations like my own accept constraints Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action -- not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term -- enhances our security And I think that's not just true for us
If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs
We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments Consider what we’ve accomplished here over the past few years
Together, we mobilized some , additional troops for UN peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home
We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering I'll be discussing that more this afternoon But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees
There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing But many nations -- particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography -- that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home
Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I've talked about here today There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together
Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering Perhaps that's our fate We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best For we have shown that we can choose a better history
Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr wrote that, Human progress never rolls  on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God” And during the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth But it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places -- an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world
I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL I draw strength from the young Americans -- entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens -- who are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be
My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world -- just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness
And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn't weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America -- it strengthens it My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons
This is what I believe: that all of us can be co-workers with God And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth
Thank you very much

Good morning, everybody I want to say a few words about the explosions that occurred here in New York City and New Jersey and the other devices that have been found in New Jersey I’ve been monitoring the situation closely and receiving frequent updates from my team And I’ve just been briefed again by FBI Director Comey In addition, I've had a chance to speak with Governors Cuomo and Christie, as well as Mayor de Blasio
We’ve seen what was apparently a pipe bomb go off in New Jersey, in Seaside Park, where it could have seriously injured our US Marines and spectators who were there for a race The bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood, here in New York, injured more than two dozen people We are extremely fortunate and grateful that nobody was killed And our prayers go out to all those who have been injured We want to wish them a speedy recovery
I especially want to commend all the outstanding police and first responders in both New York City and New Jersey for their extraordinary professionalism and their quick response, which surely prevented even more people from being hurt, and ensured that people got assistance quickly
The investigation is moving rapidly, and as is my practice, I’m going to leave it to the FBI and law enforcement to provide details I think everybody is aware at this point that there is a person of interest who is the focus of the investigation And the FBI can give you further details in terms of how that is proceeding
I told Governors Cuomo and Christie and Mayor de Blasio that they and their teams will continue to have all federal support as they move ahead with their investigations, and tracking down every lead, and working to keep the people of this city and of this region safe Law enforcement is asking for the help of the community And so to everybody in this region, I want to repeat what we've said before: If you see something suspicious, then you need to say something -- contact local law enforcement
In the meantime, I would ask that the press try to refrain from getting out ahead of the investigation I am extraordinarily happy with the cooperation that's been taking place between the FBI and state and local law enforcement officials They are moving smartly on this investigation It does not help if false reports or incomplete information is out there So try to, as much as possible, stick to what our investigators say, because they actually know what they're talking about
Meanwhile, I know that the United Nations meetings here every year already create an additional workload for New York But given the UN meetings, we also have a particularly high level of federal resources here to help as needed We’re going to make sure that everybody is working together seamlessly, as one team, to get to the bottom of what happened, to find those responsible, and to make sure that justice is done
Meanwhile, while all this is going on in New York and New Jersey, we’re also focused on the stabbing attack at the shopping mall in Minnesota At this point, we see no connection between that incident and what happened here in New York and New Jersey Our attention there is on the people who were injured And again, we are very grateful that no one lost their life Thanks to the quick action of a brave off-duty police officer, the suspect was killed and we avoided more people being hurt
I had a chance also to speak with Governor Dayton this morning I assured him that we will provide all the assistance that he needs in the investigation The FBI is investigating the Minnesota incident as a potential act of terrorism We will direct the full resources of the federal government to make sure that the investigation goes forward aggressively
And finally, I want to take this opportunity to reassure the people in this city, in this region, and Americans across our country that our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals at every level -- federal, state and local -- are working together, around the clock, to prevent attacks and to keep us safe They are the best of the best Over the years, they have thwarted many plots and saved many lives And we are incredibly grateful for their service, today and every single day
We will continue to lead the global coalition in the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks We are going to continue to go after them We're going to take out their leaders We're going to take out their infrastructure They are continuing to lose ground in Iraq and in Syria And later today, I’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to discuss the need to sustain that momentum As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is And it helps to undermine their ideology, which over time will make it harder for them to recruit and inspire people to violence And we're going to continue to enlist tech companies and community and religious leaders to push back against online extremist content and all messages of hate
At moments like this, I think it’s important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live, to undermine our values And so, even as we have to be vigilant and aggressive, both in preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don’t succumb to that fear And there’s no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey
When I was speaking to Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie and Mayor De Blasio, one point that they all made is, folks around here, they don’t get scared They’re tough, they’re resilient, they go about their business every single day And that kind of toughness and resoluteness, and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life, that’s the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American And that’s the kind of strength that is going to be absolutely critical not just in the days to come but in the years to come
By showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not, and never will, give in to fear, that’s going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry our terrorist acts against us
Thank you very much, everybody And as I said, you will be receiving, I’m sure, ongoing briefings from both the FBI and local law enforcement in terms of the details of the investigation


Good morning Scripture tells us, “Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart”
Secretary Carter, Chairman Dunford, outstanding members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, survivors of that September day and the families of those we lost -- it is a great honor, once again, to be with you on this day, a day that I know is still difficult, but which reveals the love and faithfulness in your hearts and in the heart of our nation
We remember, and we will never forget, the nearly , beautiful lives taken from us so cruelly -- including  men, women and children here, the youngest just three years old We honor the courage of those who put themselves in harm’s way to save people they never knew We come together in prayer and in gratitude for the strength that has fortified us across these  years And we renew the love and the faith that binds us together as one American family
Fifteen years may seem like a long time, but for the families who lost a piece of their heart that day, I imagine it can seem like just yesterday Perhaps it’s the memory of a last kiss given to a spouse, or the last goodbye to a mother or father, a sister or a brother We wonder how their lives might have unfolded, how their dreams might have taken shape And I am mindful that no words we offer, or deeds we do, can ever truly erase the pain of their absence
And yet, you -- the survivors and families of  -- your “steadfast love and faithfulness” has been an inspiration to me and to our entire country Even as you’ve mourned, you’ve summoned the strength to carry on In the names of those you’ve lost, you’ve started scholarships and volunteered in your communities, and done your best to be a good neighbor and a good friend and a good citizen And in your grief and grace, you have reminded us that, together, there’s nothing we Americans cannot overcome
The question before us, as always, is: How do we preserve the legacy of those we lost? How do we live up to their example? And how do we keep their spirit alive in our own hearts?
Well, we have seen the answer in a generation of Americans -- our men and women in uniform, diplomats, intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement professionals -- all who have stepped forward to serve and who have risked and given their lives to help keep us safe Thanks to their extraordinary service, we’ve dealt devastating blows to al Qaeda
We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden We’ve strengthened our homeland security We've prevented attacks We've saved lives We resolve to continue doing everything in our power to protect this country that we love And today, we once again pay tribute to these patriots, both military and civilian, who serve in our name, including those far away from home in Afghanistan and Iraq
Perhaps most of all, we stay true to the spirit of this day by defending not only our country, but also our ideals Fifteen years into this fight, the threat has evolved With our stronger defenses, terrorists often attempt attacks on a smaller, but still deadly, scale Hateful ideologies urge people in their own country to commit unspeakable violence We’ve mourned the loss of innocents from Boston to San Bernardino to Orlando
Groups like al Qaeda, like ISIL, know that we will never be able -- they will never be able to defeat a nation as great and as strong as America So, instead, they've tried to terrorize in the hopes that they can stoke enough fear that we turn on each other and that we change who we are or how we live And that's why it is so important today that we reaffirm our character as a nation -- a people drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background -- bound by a creed as old as our founding, e pluribus unum Out of many, we are one For we know that our diversity -- our patchwork heritage -- is not a weakness; it is still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths This is the America that was attacked that September morning This is the America that we must remain true to
Across our country today, Americans are coming together in service and remembrance We run our fingers over the names in memorial benches here at the Pentagon We walk the hallowed grounds of a Pennsylvania field We look up at a gleaming tower that pierces the New York City skyline But in the end, the most enduring memorial to those we lost is ensuring the America that we continue to be -- that we stay true to ourselves, that we stay true to what's best in us, that we do not let others divide us
As I mark this solemn day with you for the last time as President, I think of Americans whose stories I’ve been humbled to know these past eight years -- Americans who, I believe, embody the true spirit of 
It’s the courage of Welles Crowther, just  years old, in the South tower -- the man in the red bandana who spent his final moments helping strangers to safety before the towers fell It’s the resilience of the firehouse on Eighth Avenue -- patriots who lost more than a dozen men, but who still suit up every day as the “Pride of Midtown” It’s the love of a daughter -- Payton Wall of New Jersey -- whose father, in his last moments on the phone from the towers, told her, “I will always be watching over you”
It’s the resolve of those Navy SEALS who made sure justice was finally done, who served as we must live as a nation -- getting each other’s backs, looking out for each other, united, one mission, one team It’s the ultimate sacrifice of men and women who rest for eternity not far from here, in gentle green hills in perfect formation -- Americans who gave their lives in faraway places so that we can be here today, strong and free and proud It’s all of us -- every American who gets up each day, and lives our lives, carries on Because as Americans, we do not give in to fear We will preserve our freedoms and the way of life that makes us a beacon to the world
“Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart” And how we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a nation, we have the opportunity each and every day to live up to the sacrifice of those heroes that we lost May God bless the memory of the loved ones here and across the country They remain in our hearts today
May He watch over these faithful families and all who protect us
And may God forever bless the United States of America
