I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances ENDEND  The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil ENDEND 
I don't oppose all wars ENDEND  My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, fought in Patton's army ENDEND  He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil ENDEND 
I don't oppose all wars ENDEND 
After September , after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again ENDEND 
I don't oppose all wars ENDEND  What I am opposed to is a dumb war ENDEND  What I am opposed to is a rash war ENDEND  What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne ENDEND 
What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression ENDEND 
That's what I'm opposed to ENDEND  A dumb war ENDEND  A rash war ENDEND  A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics ENDEND 
Now let me be clear: I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein ENDEND  He is a brutal man ENDEND  A ruthless man ENDEND  A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND  The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him ENDEND 
But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history ENDEND 
I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a United States   occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences ENDEND 
I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of alQaeda ENDEND 
I am not opposed to all wars ENDEND  I'm opposed to dumb wars ENDEND  So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the president ENDEND 
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's finish the fight with Bin Laden and alQaeda, through effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security program that involves more than colorcoded warnings ENDEND 
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure that ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND we vigorously enforce a nonproliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe ENDEND 
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure our socalled allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of terrorist cells ENDEND 
You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil through an energy policy that doesn't simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil ENDEND 
Those are the battles that we need to fight ENDEND  Those are the battles that we willingly join ENDEND  The battles against ignorance and intolerance ENDEND  Corruption and greed ENDEND  Poverty and despair ENDEND 
The consequences of war are dire, the sacrifices immeasurable ENDEND  We may have occasion in our lifetime to once again rise up in defense of our freedom, and pay the wages of war ENDEND  But we ought not – we will not – travel down that hellish path blindly ENDEND  Nor should we allow those who would march off and pay the ultimate sacrifice, who would prove the full measure of devotion with their blood, to make such an awful sacrifice in vain ENDEND 
On behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention ENDEND  Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let's face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely ENDEND  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya ENDEND  He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tinroof shack ENDEND  His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant ENDEND 
But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son ENDEND  Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place: America, which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before ENDEND  While studying here, my father met my mother ENDEND  She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas ENDEND  Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression ENDEND  The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton's army and marched across Europe ENDEND  Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line ENDEND  After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity ENDEND 
And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents ENDEND  My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation ENDEND  They would give me an African name, Barack, or "blessed," believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success ENDEND  They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren't rich, because in a generous America you don't have to be rich to achieve your potential ENDEND  They are both passed away now ENDEND  Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride ENDEND 
I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my precious daughters ENDEND  I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible ENDEND  Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy ENDEND  Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, "We hold these truths to he selfevident, that all men are created equal ENDEND  That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ENDEND  That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness ENDEND "
That is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles ENDEND  That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm ENDEND  That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door ENDEND  That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody's son ENDEND  That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will he counted ? or at least, most of the time ENDEND 
This year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations ENDEND  And fellow Americans ? Democrats, Republicans, Independents ? I say to you tonight: we have more work to do ENDEND  More to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour ENDEND  More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay , a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on ENDEND  More to do for the young woman in East St ENDEND  Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn't have the money to go to college ENDEND 
Don't get me wrong ENDEND  The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don't expect government to solve all their problems ENDEND  They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to ENDEND  Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don't want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon ENDEND  Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can't teach kids to learn ENDEND  They know that parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white ENDEND  No, people don't expect government to solve all their problems ENDEND  But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all ENDEND  They know we can do better ENDEND  And they want that choice ENDEND 
In this election, we offer that choice ENDEND  Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer ENDEND  That man is John Kerry ENDEND  John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and sacrifice, because they've defined his life ENDEND  From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country ENDEND  Again and again, we've seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available ENDEND  His values and his record affirm what is best in us ENDEND 
John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded ENDEND  So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he'll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home ENDEND  John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves ENDEND  John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields ENDEND  John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us ENDEND  And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option, but it should never he the first option ENDEND 
A while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois ENDEND  He was a goodlooking kid, sixtwo or sixthree, cleareyed, with an easy smile ENDEND  He told me he'd joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week ENDEND  As I listened to him explain why he'd enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child ENDEND  But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than  service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns ENDEND  I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked longterm health benefits because they were reservists ENDEND  When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world ENDEND 
Now let me be clear ENDEND  We have real enemies in the world ENDEND  These enemies must be found ENDEND  They must be pursued and they must be defeated ENDEND  John Kerry knows this ENDEND  And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure ENDEND  John Kerry believes in America ENDEND  And he knows it's not enough for just some of us to prosper ENDEND  For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga ENDEND 
A belief that we are connected as one people ENDEND  If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that matters to me, even if it's not my child ENDEND  If there's a senior citizen somewhere who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother ENDEND  If there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties ENDEND  It's that fundamental belief ? I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper ? that makes this country work ENDEND  It's what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family ENDEND  "E pluribus unum ENDEND " Out of many, one ENDEND 
Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes ENDEND  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America there's the United States of America ENDEND  There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America ENDEND  The pundits like to sliceanddice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats ENDEND  But I've got news for them, too ENDEND  We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States ENDEND  We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States ENDEND  There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it ENDEND  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America ENDEND 
In the end, that's what this election is about ENDEND  Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope ENDEND  John Edwards calls on us to hope ENDEND  I'm not talking about blind optimism here ? the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don't talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it ENDEND  No, I'm talking about something more substantial ENDEND  It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker's son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too ENDEND  The audacity of hope
In the end, that is God's greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead ENDEND  I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity ENDEND  I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair ENDEND  I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us ENDEND  America
Tonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do ? if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come ENDEND  Thank you and God bless you ENDEND John Lewis's th Birthday Gala
Compete Text Thank you ENDEND  It's an honor to be here tonight to celebrate one of the most courageous and compassionate Americans of our time ENDEND  Happy Birthday John ENDEND 
When I was first asked to speak here, I thought to myself, never in a million years would I have guessed that I'd be serving in Congress with John Lewis ENDEND 
And then I thought, you know, there was once a time when John Lewis might never have guessed that he'd be serving in Congress ENDEND  And there was a time not long before that when people might never have guessed that someday, AfricanAmericans would be able to go to the polls, pick up a ballot, make their voice heard, and elect that Congress ENDEND 
But we can, and I'm here, because people like John Lewis believed ENDEND  Because people like John Lewis feared nothing and risked everything for those beliefs ENDEND  Because they were willing to spend sleepless nights in lonely jail cells, endure the searing pain of billy clubs cracked against their bones, and face down death simply so that all of us could share equally in the joys of life ENDEND 
How far we've come because of your courage, John ENDEND 
How far we've come from the days when the son of sharecroppers would huddle by the radio as the crackle of Dr ENDEND  King's dreams filled his heart with hope ENDEND  He was often forced to leave school to work in the fields and the public library was offlimits to his kind, and yet young John Lewis sought knowledge ENDEND  His parents were never the type to complain or try to stir up any trouble, and yet their son sought justice ENDEND 
And so he organized, even when so many tried to stop his efforts ENDEND  He spoke truths, even when they tried to silence his words ENDEND  And he marched, even when they tried to knock him down again and again and again ENDEND 
The road John chose for himself was not easy ENDEND  But the road to change never is ENDEND 
I think it's simple for us to look back forty years and think that it was all so clear then ENDEND  That while there may be room for moral ambiguity in the issues we debate today, civil rights was different ENDEND  That people generally knew what was right and what was wrong, who the good guys and the bad guys were ENDEND  But the moral certainties we now take for granted  that separate can never be equal, that the blessings of liberty enshrined in our Constitution belong to all of us, that our children should be able to go to school together and play together and grow up together  were anything but certain when John Lewis was a boy ENDEND 
And so there was struggle and sacrifice, discipline and tremendous courage ENDEND  And there was the culmination of it all one Sunday afternoon on a bridge in Alabama ENDEND 
I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day ENDEND  Not only John and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it ENDEND  Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers  a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom ENDEND 
And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage? When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation? Truly, this is the audacity of hope ENDEND 
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day  after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND after all that, they went back to march again ENDEND 
They marched again ENDEND  They crossed the bridge ENDEND  They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of  was signed into law ENDEND 
And so it was, in a story as old as our beginnings and as timeless as our hopes, that change came about because the good people of a great nation willed it so ENDEND 
Thank you, John, for going back ENDEND  Thank you for marching again ENDEND 
Thank you for reminding us that in America, ordinary citizens can somehow find in their hearts the courage to do extraordinary things ENDEND  That in the face of the fiercest resistance and the most crushing oppression, one voice can be willing to stand up and say that's wrong and this is right and here's why ENDEND  And say it again ENDEND  And say it louder ENDEND  And keep saying it until other voices join the chorus to sing the songs that set us free ENDEND 
Today, I'm sure you'll all agree that we have songs left to sing and bridges left to cross ENDEND  And if there's anything we can learn from this living saint sitting beside me, it is that change is never easy, but always possible ENDEND  That it comes not from violence or militancy or the kind of politics that pits us against each other and plays on our worst fears; but from great discipline and organization, from a strong message of hope, and from the courage to turn against the tide so that the tide eventually may be turned ENDEND 
Today, we need that courage ENDEND  We need the courage to say that it's wrong that one out of every five children is born into poverty in the richest country on Earth ENDEND  And it's right to do whatever necessary to provide our children the care and the education they need to live up to their Godgiven potential ENDEND 
It's wrong to tell hardworking families who are earning less and paying more in taxes that we can't do anything to help them buy their own home or send their kids to college or care for them when they're sick ENDEND  And it's right to expect that if you're willing to work hard in this country of American Dreamers, the sky is the limit on what you can achieve ENDEND 
It's wrong to tell those brave men and women who are willing to fight and die for this country that when they come home, we may not have room for them at the VA hospitals or the benefits we promised them ENDEND  And it's right to always provide the very best care for the very best of America ENDEND 
My friends, we have not come this far as a people and a nation because we believe that we're better off simply fending for ourselves ENDEND  We are here because we believe that all men are created equal, and that we are all connected to each other as one people ENDEND  And we need to say that more ENDEND  And say it again ENDEND  And keep saying it ENDEND 
And where will our courage come from to speak these truths? When we stand on our own Edmund Pettus Bridge, what hope will sustain us?
I believe it is the hope of knowing that people like John Lewis have stood on that same bridge and lived to cross it ENDEND 
For me, this kind of hope often comes from a memory of a trip I took during the campaign ENDEND  About a week after the primary, Dick Durbin and I embarked on a nineteen city tour of Southern Illinois ENDEND  And one of the towns we went to was a place called Cairo, which, as many of you might know, achieved a certain notoriety during the late s and early s as having one of the worst racial climates in the country ENDEND  You had an active white citizen's council there, you had cross burnings, Jewish families were being harassed, you had segregated schools, race riots, you name it  it was going on in Cairo ENDEND 
And we're riding down to Cairo and Dick Durbin turns to me and says, "Let me tell you about the first time I went to Cairo ENDEND  It was about  years ago ENDEND  I was  years old and Paul Simon, who was Lieutenant Governor at the time, sent me down there to investigate what could be done to improve the racial climate in Cairo ENDEND "
And Dick tells me how he diligently goes down there and gets picked up by a local resident who takes him to his motel ENDEND  And as Dick's getting out of the car, the driver says "excuse me, let me just give you a piece of advice ENDEND  Don't use the phone in your motel room because the switchboard operator is a member of the white citizen's council, and they'll report on anything you do ENDEND "
Well, this obviously makes Dick Durbin upset, but he's a brave young man, so he checks in to his room, unpacks his bags and a few minutes later he hears a knock on the door ENDEND  He opens up the door and there's a guy standing there who just stares at Dick for a second, and then says, "What the hell are you doing here?" and walks away ENDEND 
Well, now Dick is really feeling concerned and so am I because as he's telling me this story, we're pulling in to Cairo ENDEND  So I'm wondering what kind of reception we're going to get ENDEND  And we wind our way through the town and we go past the old courthouse, take a turn and suddenly we're in a big parking lot and about  people are standing there ENDEND  About a fourth of them are black and three fourths are white and they all are about the age where they would have been active participants in the epic struggle that had taken place thirty years earlier ENDEND 
And as we pull closer, I see something ENDEND  All of these people are wearing these little buttons that say "Obama for United States   Senate ENDEND " And they start smiling ENDEND  And they start waving ENDEND  And Dick and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a thing ENDEND  Because if you told Dick thirty years ago that he  the son of Lithuania immigrants born into very modest means in east St ENDEND  Louis  would be returning to Cairo as a sitting United States Senator, and that he would have in tow a black guy born in Hawaii with a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas named Barack Obama, no one would have believed it ENDEND 
But it happened ENDEND  And it happened because John Lewis and scores of brave Americans stood on that bridge and lived to cross it ENDEND 
You know, two weeks after Bloody Sunday, when the march finally reached Montgomery, Martin Luther King Jr ENDEND  spoke to the crowd of thousands and said "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice ENDEND " He's right, but you know what? It doesn't bend on its own ENDEND  It bends because we help it bend that way ENDEND  Because people like John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks and thousands of ordinary Americans with extraordinary courage have helped bend it that way ENDEND  And as their examples call out to us from across the generations, we continue to progress as a people because they inspire us to take our own two hands and bend that arc ENDEND  Thank you John ENDEND  May God Bless you, and may God Bless these United States of America ENDEND 

This issue should force us to face a fundamental question about who we are as a country, how we progress as a society, and where our values lie as a people:
How do we treat our fellow Americans who have fallen on hard times, and what is our responsibility to cushion those falls when they occur?
Proponents claim this bill is designed to curb the worst abuses of our bankruptcy system ENDEND  That's a worthy goal, and we can all agree that bankruptcy was never meant to serve as a Get Out of Jail Free Card, for use when you've foolishly gambled away all your savings and don't feel like taking responsibility for your actions ENDEND  Business owners and creditors deserve the money they're owed, and anyone who tries to scam the system just because they can should be stopped and forced to pay their debt ENDEND 
But to accomplish that, this bill would take us from a system where judges weed out the abusers from the honest to a system where all the honest are presumed to be abusers ENDEND  Where declaring Chapter  bankruptcy is made prohibitively expensive for people who already have suffered financial devastation ENDEND  With this bill, it doesn't matter if you ran up your debt on a trip to Vegas or a trip to the Emergency Room, you're still treated the same under the law and you still face the possibility that you'll never get the chance to start over ENDEND 
Now, it would be one thing if most people were abusing the system and falling into bankruptcy because they were irresponsible with their finances ENDEND  But we know that's not the case ENDEND  We know that most people fall into bankruptcy as a result of bad luck ENDEND  And we know that a recent Harvard study showed that nearly half of all bankruptcies occur because of an illness that ends up sticking families with medical bills they just can't keep up with ENDEND 
Take the case of Suzanne Gibbons ENDEND  A few years back, Suzanne had a good job as a nurse and a home on Chicago's Northwest Side ENDEND  Then she suffered a stroke that left her hospitalized for fivedays ENDEND  And even though she had health insurance through her job, it only covered , of her , hospital bill ENDEND 
Because of her illness, she was soon forced to leave her fulltime nursing job and take a temp job that paid less and didn't offer health insurance ENDEND  Then the collection agencies started coming after her for hospital bills that she just couldn't keep up with ENDEND  She lost her retirement savings, she lost her house, and eventually, she was forced to declare bankruptcy ENDEND 
If this bill passes as written, Suzanne would be treated by the law the same as any scam artist who cheats the system ENDEND  The decision about whether or not she can file for Chapter  bankruptcy would never take into account the fact that she fell into financial despair because of her illness ENDEND  With all that debt, she would have had to hire a lawyer and pay hundreds of dollars more in increased paperwork ENDEND  And after all that, she still may have been told that she was ineligible for Chapter  bankruptcy ENDEND 
And so, as much as we'd like to believe that the face of this bankruptcy crisis is credit card addicts who spend their way into debt, the truth is that it's the face of people like Suzanne Gibbons ENDEND  It's the face of middleclass America ENDEND  Over the last thirty years bankruptcies have gone up   and we've had more than , in Illinois just last year ENDEND  We also know what else has gone up: the cost of child care and the cost of college, the cost home ownership and the cost of health care  which is now at a record high ENDEND  People are working harder and longer for less, and they're falling further and further behind ENDEND 
And we're not talking about the poor or even just the working poor here ENDEND  As bankruptcy professor Elizabeth Warren has noted, these are middleclass families with two parents who both work at goodpaying jobs that put a roof over their heads ENDEND  They're saving every extra penny they have so that their children can someday do better than they did ENDEND  But with just one illness, emergency, or divorce, those dreams can be wiped out ENDEND  This bill does a great job helping the credit card industry recover the profits they're losing, but what are we doing to help middleclass families recover the dreams they're losing?
This bill does a great job protecting credit card companies from the few bad apples who try to escape their debt, but what does it do to protect the American public from the credit card companies who try to take advantage of them?
And if we're going to crack down on bankruptcy abuse, we should make it clear that we intend to hold the wealthy and the powerful accountable too ENDEND  As it is now, this bill makes it easier for a company like Enron who just bilked their employees out of their life savings to declare bankruptcy than for the employees themselves ENDEND  In my own state, we even had a mining company by the name of Horizon declare bankruptcy and then refuse to pay its employees the health benefits it owed them ENDEND 
The Mine Workers involved had provided a total of , years of service and dedication and sacrifice to this company ENDEND  They spent their lives working hard ENDEND  They did their part ENDEND  But Horizon didn't do its part, and it was allowed to hide behind bankruptcy laws to leave these workers without the care they had earned ENDEND 
This is wrong ENDEND  It's wrong that this bill would make it harder for these unemployed workers to declare bankruptcy, while doing nothing to prevent the bankrupt company that put them there from shirking its responsibility entirely ENDEND 
What kind of a message does it send when we tell hardworking, middleclass Americans, "You have to be more responsible with your finances, but the corporations you work for can be as irresponsible as they want with theirs"?
We must reform our bankruptcy code so that corporations keep their promises and meet their obligations to their workers ENDEND  And while I remain hopeful that our companies want to do the right thing for their workers, doing so should not be a choice  it should be a mandate ENDEND 
Senator Rockefeller has two amendments to do this that I have cosponsored and urge my colleagues to support ENDEND  One would increase the required payments of wages and employee benefit plans to , per individual from the current level of , ENDEND  And it would also require companies that emerge from bankruptcy to immediately pay each retiree who lost health benefits an amount of cash equal to what a retiree would be expected to have to pay for COBRA coverage for  months ENDEND  The second amendment would prevent bankruptcy courts from dismissing companies' coal act obligations to pay their workers the benefits they promised them ENDEND  These companies made a deal to their mine workers, and they should be forced to honor that deal ENDEND 
 
But there are also millions of middleclass families out there who are struggling to get by ENDEND  They work hard, they love their children, and they're willing to do anything to give them the best possible shot in life ENDEND  And in the ten minutes since I've been talking, about thirty of them have filed for bankruptcy ENDEND 
We live in a rapidly changing world with an economy that's moving just as fast ENDEND  We can't always control this and we can't promise that the changes will always leave everyone better off ENDEND 
But we can do better than one bankruptcy every nineteen seconds ENDEND  We can do better than forcing people to choose between the cost of health care and the cost of college ENDEND  We can do better than big corporations using bankruptcy laws to deny health care and benefits to their employees ENDEND  And we can give people the basic tools and protections they need to believe that in America, your circumstance is no limit to the success you may achieve and the dreams you may fulfill ENDEND 
And so, while I cannot support this bill the way it is written, I do look forward to working with my colleagues in amending this bill so that we can still keep that promise alive ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 
Thank you John Doer ENDEND  It's great to be here with all of you today, and I'm honored that you've given me the opportunity to join this discussion about the role technology can play in our future and our children's future ENDEND  And before we begin, I'd just like to recognize your CEO, Rick White, who is leaving TechNet after years of inspired leadership and service to this organization and this country ENDEND  Thank you Rick ENDEND 
We're here today because when it comes to the global economy, the rules of the game have changed ENDEND  This is a fact not only understood by a roomful of Silicon Valley CEOs, but by families I met all across Illinois during the campaign ENDEND  They know that when it comes to their jobs and their wages, they're not only competing with workers in Naperville and Carbondale, but in New Delhi and Calcutta ENDEND  What's more, they know that when it comes to the hightech, high skill jobs of the future, their children are not only competing with children here in the United States, but with those on the other side of the globe who are increasingly being educated earlier, longer, and with a special emphasis on the math and science skills required for the industries of tomorrow ENDEND 
These families tell me that they're anxious about their future ENDEND  They worry that they could become the first generation of Americans to see their children do worse than they did ENDEND  They remember that when we were all growing up, our parents knew that if they pushed us to study and work hard, the best universities would be open to us and we could get any job we wanted ENDEND  But today, parents in cities and towns all over America are losing that hope  they're losing the sense that their kids will be able to dream the American dream ENDEND 
The rules of the game have changed ENDEND  And so we must change with them ENDEND  But in a country of innovators and optimists  a country that pioneered the first moon landing, discovered the cure for polio, and led the technological revolution of the nineties  I have no doubt that we can ENDEND  This is the great project for our time, and so it must become a larger part of the debate in our politics, our businesses, our schools and our homes ENDEND 
The good news is that we have the resources, we have the brainpower, and we are still an economic and technological giant ENDEND  In Illinois alone we have , hightech workers ENDEND  The University of Illinois at ChampagneUrbana is where Marc Andreesen developed Mosaic, the browser that made the World Wide Web what it is today ENDEND  And right now at Argonne National Laboratory, scientists are developing the technology for "grid computing"  which IBM and others believe represents the future of the IT industry ENDEND 
All across America, worldclass universities, firstrate research facilities and brilliant minds are on the cusp of discovering the next big idea that will lift up the quality of our lives, create millions of new jobs, and change our world ENDEND  We can take comfort in knowing that, but we can't take it for granted, because right now other countries are looking at places like Silicon Valley and North Carolina's Research Triangle and saying "we want that ENDEND " They're investing in better universities, expanding research budgets and venture capital, producing more science and engineering graduates, and passing innovationfriendly public policies ENDEND 
None of us expect or want the government to lead the next technological revolution, but I believe that we can provide the spark that fuels America's innovation and competitiveness in the global economy ENDEND  I believe we can do better than cutting the budget for the National Science Foundation, as this year's budget has done for the first time ENDEND  We can do better than falling to th place in the world when it comes to providing people with access to Broadband ENDEND  We can do better when it comes to using technology to free ourselves from America's dangerous dependence on Mideast oil ENDEND  We can do better than burdening businesses with cases of class action abuse, and that's why I cast a tough vote in favor of reform the other week ENDEND 
And we can do better, think bigger, and act bolder when it comes to education in this country ENDEND  The best part about Bill Gates' speech last week was when he said that our schools are in danger of becoming obsolete as tools to educate tomorrow's workers for tomorrow's jobs ENDEND  But schools are where our children's dreams begin, and so schools are where we must begin to make those dreams come true ENDEND 
We shouldn't wait until high school either ENDEND  We have to start the way Jim Barksdale of Netscape did when he gave a big grant and a lot of hope to preschoolers in Mississippi ENDEND  We can't leave kids behind before they even enter the first grade, and that's why I'll continue to focus on early childhood education as a way to give them the best start in life ENDEND 
We also know that some of the best ideas in education don't come from Washington, but from local schools all over America ENDEND  That's why charter schools are a great way for us to learn from experiments in Topeka and Springfield that schools in Chicago and L ENDEND A ENDEND  can replicate in their own classrooms ENDEND  And because the success of your businesses depend on your ability to fill jobs with great minds, we need more corporate and private investment in our schools ENDEND  John Doer's work with the New Schools Venture Fund is leading the way on this front, and we should all commend him for that ENDEND 
As parents and citizens, each of us has a stake in making sure that our schools are doing everything possible to give our kids the competitive edge they'll need in a st century economy ENDEND  The tests we have now are great ways to gather information about what works and what doesn't, but they're not enough ENDEND  I believe that to meet tomorrow's challenges, we should create a national network of academies to train , new teachers and get them into highneed rural and urban schools ENDEND  We should give local schools the latest technology training tools as John Chambers has done with the CISCO Networking Academy Program ENDEND  When I was at the University of Chicago, other faculty members and myself developed a program where we essentially adopted primary schools to help them learn how to use the technological opportunities they were being offered ENDEND  It's not enough just to set down a computer in a classroom and walk away  we must also train teachers and administrators on how to use that computer and its technology to find new and better ways of educating our children ENDEND 
Finally, we should work to close the gap that is widening between America and the rest of the world when it comes to math and science graduates ENDEND 
To do this, we must start by inspiring our children with a sense of purpose ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND by nurturing their imagination so that they may dream big and then work hard to reach those dreams ENDEND  Too often, our children spend hours playing Playstation without ever finding out how to build Playstation ENDEND  They watch television but never wonder how it's put together ENDEND  They surf web page after web page on the Internet, but are never taught how to design one ENDEND 
The incredible story of progress that is America has always been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not ENDEND  Our schools must begin instilling that wonder in our children again so that their generation will unite around the next great project of our time, whether it be declaring America energy independent or launching the next great technological revolution ENDEND 
Too often, the debate about education here in Washington degenerates to old arguments and stale ideas ENDEND  And so it's time to put aside partisan differences and just talk about what works for our kids and what will keep America competitive in this new century ENDEND  Those are goals we all have and hopes we all share ENDEND 
Yes, the rules of the game have changed ENDEND  And now it's time for us to prove to the world that we can still play better than anyone ENDEND  The families I've met are ready to try ENDEND  Their kids are ready ENDEND  TechNet is ready ENDEND  And in the coming months, I will do my best to work with my colleagues and make sure our government is ready too ENDEND  I want to thank TechNet for doing your part to get this dialogue going, and now I'd like to take a few questions from the audience ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND CURE Keynote Address

Thank you David for that warm introduction ENDEND  David is not only one of the most brilliant political minds in the business today, he is a loving husband, a committed father, and a dear friend who I've been honored to have by my side ENDEND  Thank you David for everything you do ENDEND 
I also want to thank Susan Axelrod and the entire leadership of CURE for allowing me the honor of speaking here this evening ENDEND  As many of you know, Susan lives and breathes this organization, from the earliest hours of the morning until late at night, every day of her life ENDEND  And I have no doubt that if the rest of us are willing to offer just a fraction of her level of passion and commitment to this cause, one day we'll be gathered here to finally celebrate a cure ENDEND 
Since I first learned about this organization from David and Susan, I've often thought about the simple act of hope that began its journey ENDEND 
I've thought about three mothers, sitting around a kitchen table, sharing the pain and the helplessness that go along with watching the child you love, the child whose happiness you live for, struggle with a disease that mom and dad can't fix ENDEND  A disease that doesn't necessarily go away with the doctor's medicine, that isn't talked about most nights on the news, that isn't funded and recognized like a lot of the other diseases ENDEND 
But then I also thought about how on that day, those three mothers said "no more ENDEND " Maybe it was the memory of the first time they saw a seizure take their child to that lonely place where they could no longer reach them ENDEND  Maybe they thought about the  ENDEND  million Americans who suffer from epilepsy, the tens of thousands who succumb to it, and the , more who will be diagnosed this year ENDEND 
Or maybe as they sat around that kitchen table, three friends living similar experiences, they simply realized that there are some challenges in life you can't take on by yourself ENDEND  That there is power and strength in the ability of a community to make a difference ENDEND  And that as that community reaches out and grows and finds its voice, so grows the hope that it will someday find a cure ENDEND 
Well, seven years, thirty research grants, one White House conference, and over  million in donations later, I can see tonight that the kitchen table has become a lot more crowded and that this community is on its way ENDEND 
And yet despite all the progress, the question still weighing on your minds is, "how do we get all the way there?" How do we get all the way there when, despite the fact that epilepsy affects more Americans than Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and cerebral palsy combined, it still receives far fewer federal research dollars than any of these diseases? How do we get there when too many policy makers and too much of the public still think that epilepsy is, as Brendan Malone told us in the video, an "inconvenience," rather than a serious, and possibly deadly disease?
I think that we get there the same way that so many of you got us here  by continuing to share your stories and your children's stories with the faith that more and more Americans will open their hearts to listen ENDEND  With the faith that if there's a little boy who can't sit through a class without suffering the pain and uncomfortable stares that accompany a seizure, it matters to every mother, even if it's not her son ENDEND  That if there's a young woman who can't work and can't take care of herself and can't have children of her own because of the brain damage caused by epilepsy, it matters to every father, even if it's not his daughter ENDEND 
Personally, I can't begin to imagine what a parent who has a child with epilepsy goes through on a daily basis ENDEND  But I know what it's like to be a parent ENDEND  And as a father with a little girl who suffers from asthma, I can understand the terror you feel when your child wakes you in the middle of the night gasping for air ENDEND  When you would rather stop breathing yourself if it meant that she could start breathing just a little easier ENDEND 
In this way, your stories touch me as both a father and a friend, and I will leave here tonight having adopted your cause as my own, as so many have done before me ENDEND  I will go back to Washington and work with my colleague Rahm Emanuel and others to demand more federal funding for epilepsy research ENDEND 
But I also believe that if each of us walks out of here and tells the story of the  ENDEND  million parents, brothers, sisters, daughters, and sons with epilepsy, it will touch others who may not understand this disease, because they are mothers and fathers and friends too ENDEND  And as they embrace our cause, we will expand this community of concern until there isn't any room left in this country not to listen ENDEND 
This has been the story of CURE ever since its founding  the inspiring idea that those of you who have dedicated so much of yourselves to this cause are doing so knowing full well that a cure may not arrive in time to heal your loved ones ENDEND  And yet, you continue fighting with the hope that you may spare a nameless face the pain your families have known ENDEND  That kind of compassion is heroic, and it is the kind that will eventually defeat this disease ENDEND 
We need this victory now more than ever because today, we face a new threat in the potential spread of epilepsy to thousands more Americans ENDEND  Just last week, USA Today reported that hundreds of United States   soldiers are returning from Iraq with a condition known as traumatic brain injury, or TBI ENDEND  Even though new technology and better body armor are helping them survive bomb and rocket attacks, the blasts are still causing these soldiers brain damage ENDEND  As of January,  cases have been diagnosed in Army hospitals alone, and some doctors are saying that it could become the "signature wound of the Iraq war ENDEND "
As some of you may know, TBI is the greatest risk factor for developing epilepsy ENDEND  In fact, a study of Vietnam vets showed that  percent of those who suffered TBI went on to develop the disease ENDEND 
We have asked these brave men and women to leave their homes, leave their families, and fight for our freedom on the other side of the world ENDEND  And now we are finding out that when they come home, they may develop a lifethreatening, debilitating disease that this country has not done nearly enough to treat ENDEND  We simply cannot tell our heroes that when it comes to dealing with TBI or epilepsy, they're on their own ENDEND  I know CURE won't, and I will go back to Washington and make sure the federal government won't either ENDEND  I plan to work with my colleagues in Congress to provide the VA with the funds to research TBI and epilepsy so we can learn more about the disease and develop better tools to care for our heroes ENDEND  These soldiers have moms and dads waiting for them at home, they are a part of our community, and we will speak for them ENDEND 
I know that a lot of you have been struggling with epilepsy for a long time now, and that you've seen both good days and bad ENDEND  On the bad days, it may seem like salvation will never come, that parents and children will be suffering with this disease for decades to come ENDEND 
But I think we find hope by remembering that we've been here before ENDEND  That there was a time when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands  especially children  disabled for life ENDEND  And just as it seemed that no one was paying attention and nothing could be done, a community of compassion awoke and led a March of Dimes to find the cure for polio ENDEND 
Organized with the help of Franklin Roosevelt and backed by the federal government, the March of Dimes galvanized a nation to conquer polio, dime by dime ENDEND  And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own ENDEND 
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago next month, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine ENDEND 
I know that we don't have a President with epilepsy, or a major celebrity spokesperson, but we do have a growing community that is on the march ENDEND  We have allies in government who know that we can defeat this disease if we work together ENDEND  And we have the hope that every parent has for their child ENDEND 
The hope you have the first time you bring them to the doctor's office, and you just want them to walk out with some medicine and a lollipop ENDEND  The hope you have the first day you watch them get on the bus, when you want them to fit in with the rest of the kids and do well in school ENDEND  The hope you have the day of their first job, when you want them to call you and let you know how great it went ENDEND  The hope you have when they walk down the aisle, when you want nothing more than for them to find love and happiness in life ENDEND 
These are hopes we hold not only for our own children, but for every parent and every child every where ENDEND  And if we leave here tonight determined to turn those hopes into action, into a sustained commitment to fight epilepsy that's more than just about one fundraiser or one benefit, we will find a cure and we will keep hope alive for millions of families for generations to come ENDEND  Thank you, and God Bless you ENDEND American Legion Legislative Rally
Remarks by Senator Barack Obama
Thank you ENDEND  It's an honor to be here today with all of you Legionnaires ENDEND  Since joining the Veterans Affairs Committee last month, I've been holding town halls with veterans all over Illinois, and I can tell you that in the days ahead, there will be few issues I'll work harder on than ensuring that the brave men and women who serve our country receive the support they deserve and the benefits they've earned when they come home ENDEND 
In the coming weeks, you'll hear a lot of debate over the veterans' budget that President Bush submitted to Congress ENDEND  You'll hear people talk about what we can afford and what adds up on paper, about where we can save money and what percentage increase or decrease we should give to this program or that program ENDEND 
But I know those aren't the first things that came to your mind when you heard about this budget ENDEND  And they're not the first things that came to my mind either ENDEND 
I thought about my grandfather, who signed up for duty in World War II the day after Pearl Harbor ENDEND  He marched across Europe in Patton's army, and when he came home, it was the education and opportunity offered by the GI Bill that allowed his family to build their own American Dream ENDEND 
I thought about the hundreds of Illinois veterans I've met over the last few years ENDEND  We asked them to leave their homes, leave their families, and risk their lives in some faroff place to protect us ENDEND  And yet, somehow, we're still hearing stories like the one I heard from a veteran named Bill Allen, who told me that on a trip to Chicago, he actually saw homeless veterans fighting over access to the dumpsters ENDEND  That's what I thought about ENDEND  And finally, I thought about a young man named Seamus Ahern, who I met during the campaign at a V ENDEND F ENDEND W ENDEND  hall in East Moline, Illinois ENDEND  He told me about how he'd joined the Marines because he was so proud of this country, and he felt that as a young person in his early twenties he wanted to give something back ENDEND  He was getting shipped out to Iraq the following week, and as I listened to him explain why he?d enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might hope for in a child ENDEND  But then I asked myself: When Shamus comes home, will we serve him as well as he served us? That's the question we should be asking ourselves when we talk about veterans' benefits and the veterans' budget ENDEND  And that's the standard we should meet ENDEND 
But how do we meet that standard and serve our veterans when we have a budget that, when adjusted for inflation, has even less money for veterans than it did a year ago? When we have less for health care, for hospitals, and for disability pay?
This budget tells our veterans that if you want increased funding for the VA, you'll have to pay for it yourself ENDEND  It's a budget that charges  ENDEND  million veterans a  enrollment fee just to enter into the health care program they were promised upon enlisting ENDEND  A budget that more than doubles veterans' prescription drug copayments ENDEND  That will cut  million in funding for veterans' nursing homes, and will eliminate more than  million in state grants that are desperately needed by VA facilities across the country ENDEND 
And this is a budget that tells all those veterans still waiting for help to keep waiting ENDEND  There are roughly , compensation and pension claims still unprocessed, but this budget only calls for  new employees to help deal with this backlog ? not enough to make a dent ENDEND  In Chicago, veterans are waiting an average of  days just to start the sometimes decadelong process of getting their disability claim processed ENDEND   days ENDEND  How can we make our heroes wait this long?
As troops continue to come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, the numbers and the need will only increase ENDEND  We know that soldiers are already coming home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and we know that a recent Army study showed that one in six soldiers in Iraq reported symptoms of major depression ENDEND  Some experts predict that more than , soldiers may need some kind of mental health treatment when they come home ENDEND  For tens of thousands of others, the wounds they suffered in battle will need care that could last a lifetime ENDEND 
It is not only our patriotic duty to provide this care, it is our moral duty at the most fundamental level ENDEND  When our troops return from battle, we should welcome them with the promise of opportunity, not the threat of poverty ENDEND 
Over half a century ago, it was American Legion National Commander Harry Colmery who first drafted the legislation longhand that would become the GI Bill of Rights ? a bill that has since provided education and training for nearly  million Americans, housing for nearly  million families, and led to the creation of the great American middleclass ENDEND  That was a bill that told our heroes "When you come home, we're here for you, because we're all in this together ENDEND "
Today, we shouldn't be scraping to find the bare minimum in benefits and health care for our veterans ENDEND  And with the largest deployment of troops since Vietnam fighting for freedom in an increasingly dangerous world, we should be talking about a GI Bill for the st Century ENDEND 
Fortunately, my colleague, Congressman Rahm Emanuel, has just introduced such a bill ENDEND  It's called the Welcome Home Package, and it offers veterans the exact same health care they received during their time in the service, double the education benefit they receive now, and a , down payment on a home ENDEND 
When veterans look to Congress for help, this is the kind of legislation they should hear about ? not budget cuts and increased fees ENDEND 
It's time to reassess our priorities ENDEND  A budget is more than just a series of numbers on a page; it is an embodiment of our values ENDEND  The President never hesitates to praise the service of our veterans and acknowledge the debt we owe them for their service, and I commend him for that ENDEND  Now I hope he will renew his commitment by increasing funding for the VA, and ensure that our veterans receive more than just words of praise, but also the health care and benefits they?ve earned ENDEND 
George Washington once said: "the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by our nation ENDEND "
Washington understood then what every veteran here knows now ? that when we make the decision to send our troops to war, we also make the decision to care for them, to speak for them, and to think of them ? always ? when they come ENDEND  Thank you and God Bless you ENDEND 

Mr. Chairman and Senator Biden, the position of United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations is one of the most important diplomatic positions in the entire United States   government ENDEND 
Some of the most distinguished Americans  Democrats and Republicans like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, George H ENDEND W ENDEND  Bush, and Henry Cabot Lodge  have served with honor in this position ENDEND 
Yet, there is one man from my home state of Illinois whose experience as Permanent Representative is quite relevant today ENDEND 
Adlai Stevenson served in this position during the Cuban Missile Crisis ENDEND  And, as we all know, it was Stevenson's presentation to the United Nations Security Council that proved to the world that the Soviets were moving intermediate range missiles into Cuba ENDEND  Using charts and photos to build a compelling case, Stevenson declared to Soviet Ambassador Zorin that he was prepared to wait "until Hell freezes over" for Zorin's response to the United States   charges ENDEND 
What few people remember is that Stevenson's presentation came on the heels of what one might call an "intelligence failure ENDEND " A year earlier, Stevenson had been misled by the White House and the CIA into publicly stating that the United States was not behind the Bay of Pigs invasion ENDEND  Stevenson almost resigned over the incident ENDEND 
This series of events is important to keep in mind today ENDEND  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were able to succeed diplomatically because of the stature and integrity of our Permanent Representative to the United Nations ENDEND  In fact, President Kennedy said that, "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our greatest national assets ENDEND "
As a result, Adlai Stevenson was able to get tough, isolate the Soviets, and convince the world we were right ENDEND 
Today, we face a similar situation ENDEND  With the rest of the world questioning our intelligence capabilities, and nuclear proliferation threats from Iran to North Korea that may require action by the United Nations Security Council, we must be able to convince the world that we are right ENDEND  Now, more than ever, we need a credible messenger at the United Nations ENDEND 
Unfortunately, I have some serious reservations about whether Mr. Bolton is the right man for the job:
First, senior United States   intelligence officials have called into question Mr. Bolton's credibility on statements he's made about nonproliferation ENDEND  There are also accusations related to political pressure on intelligence analysts who did not agree with Mr. Bolton's statements ENDEND  Considering that he's the top arms control official at the State Department, this is troubling to say the least ENDEND 
Second, Mr. Bolton's history of inflammatory statements about the United Nations would seem to make it more difficult for him to advance United States interests at the United Nations  I am concerned about whether Mr. Bolton even believes the United Nations  is a viable institution and a useful instrument of United States foreign policy ENDEND  Saying that it wouldn't make a difference if you lop off ten floors of the UN building in New York isn't exactly the best way to earn people's respect and support  whatever the context ENDEND 
Finally, Mr. Bolton appears to have an overly confrontational history with several memberstates on the Security Council ENDEND  Like Adlai Stevenson, I believe there are times to be tough ENDEND  But statements like "I don't do carrots" coming from someone who wants to be our chief diplomat at the United Nations certainly give me pause ENDEND 
Mr. Chairman, there is no question that we need someone in New York who is unafraid to shake things up and challenge the status quo ENDEND  But, we also need someone with the credibility, temperament, and diplomatic skill to work with other nations, form coalitions, and advance United States   interests ENDEND 
That is why I've invoked the memory of Adlai Stevenson here today: he was tough; he was credible; he was diplomatic ENDEND  Most importantly, he was effective ENDEND  Stevenson proved that we should not make compromises or tradeoffs when selecting our Representative to the United Nations 
I want to give Mr. Bolton a chance to speak on these issues, and so my mind is not made up yet ENDEND  I want to hear from him as to how he can be an effective and credible advocate for the United States   I look forward to hearing his testimony and answers to the Committee's questions ENDEND 
 
During my Senate campaign, I had the privilege and the opportunity to meet Americans from all walks of life and both ends of the political spectrum ENDEND  They told me about their lives, about their hopes, about the issues that mattered to them, and they also told me what they think about Washington ENDEND 
Because you've all heard it yourselves, I know it won't surprise many of you to learn that a lot of people don't think much gets done around here about the issues they care most about ENDEND  They think the atmosphere has become too partisan, the arguments have become too nasty, and the political agendas have become too petty ENDEND 
And while I haven't been here too long, I've noticed that partisan debate is sharp, and dissent is not always wellreceived ENDEND  Honest differences of opinion and principled compromise often seem to be the victim of a determination to score points against one's opponents ENDEND 
But the American people sent us here to be their voice ENDEND  They understand that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also hope that we can disagree without being disagreeable ENDEND  And at the end of the day, they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business done ENDEND 
What they don't expect is for one party  be it Republican or Democrat  to change the rules in the middle of the game so that they can make all the decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet ENDEND  The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster  if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate  then the fighting and the bitterness and the gridlock will only get worse ENDEND 
I understand that Republicans are getting a lot of pressure to do this from factions outside the chamber ENDEND  But we need to rise above an "ends justify the means" mentality because we're here to answer to the people  all of the people  not just the ones wearing our party label ENDEND 
The fact is that both parties have worked together to confirm  of this President's judicial nominees ENDEND  The Senate has accepted  of his  selections ENDEND  In fact, we just confirmed another one judge this week by a vote of  ENDEND  Overall, this is a better record than any President's had in the last  years ENDEND  For a President who received  of the vote and a Senate chamber made up of  of the President's party, I'd say that confirming  of your judicial nominations is a record I'd be pretty happy with ENDEND 
Again, I urge my Republican colleagues not to go through with changing these rules ENDEND  In the long run, this is not a good result for either party ENDEND  One day Democrats will be in the majority again, and this rule change will be no fairer to a Republican minority than it is to a Democratic minority ENDEND 

Right now, we're faced with rising gas prices, skyrocketing tuition costs, a record number of uninsured Americans, and some of the most serious national security threats we've ever had, all while our bravest young men and women are risking their lives halfway around the world to keep us safe ENDEND 
These are challenges we all want to meet and problems we all want to solve, even if we don't all agree how to do it ENDEND  But if the right of free and open debate is taken away from the minority party and the millions of Americans who asked us to be their voice, I fear that the already partisan atmosphere of Washington will be poisoned to the point where no one will be able to agree on anything ENDEND  That doesn't serve anyone's best interests, and it certainly isn't what the patriots who founded this democracy had in mind ENDEND 
We owe the people who sent us here more than that ENDEND  We owe them much more ENDEND 
Thank you ENDEND 

Congratulations After four long years of endless studying, sleepless nights, and constant stress, who's ready to kick back, relax, and jump head first into their residency?
And who wishes people would stop making that joke? I thought so ENDEND 
It's an honor to be back here at the University of Chicago ENDEND  As most of you know, I used to teach over at the law school and my wife Michelle is in charge of community affairs at the hospital, so as a part of the family we're especially proud of you all right now ENDEND 
We're also especially hopeful ENDEND  With the caliber of talent and amazing dedication represented here today, I found myself thinking that in one of these chairs could sit the researcher who will finally win humanity's long battle against cancer ENDEND  In one of these chairs could sit the scientist who transforms AIDS from one of the greatest disasters of the th century to one of the most curable diseases of the st ENDEND  In one of these chairs could sit the doctor who says " Barack, don't worry about that trick knee  you're just getting old ENDEND " So that's hopeful too ENDEND 
But this hope that I have for your class  this faith in our ability to overcome that which threatens to halt the march of human progress  is nothing new ENDEND  It is as old as our history and as powerful as the idea of America itself ENDEND  And that's because we've been here before ENDEND 
Almost eighty years ago, when the University of Chicago's first graduating class sat here ready to collect their diplomas, who would have dared to believe that before the beginning of the next century, we would add thirty years to the average lifespan and witness a  drop in the rate of infant death? Who would have dared to believe that with a simple vaccine, we could eliminate a disease that left millions without the ability to walk? That we could transplant a heart or resuscitate one that stopped? That we could unlock the greatest mysteries of life from the most basic building blocks of our existence?
In a time where you were lucky to live past fifty and doomed if you came down with the flu, who would have dared to believe these things?
The people who once sat in your chairs  they did ENDEND  The doctors and nurses, researchers and scientists who came before ENDEND  Who grew up believing that in America, the most improbable of all experiments, the place where we continue to defy the odds and write our own history, they could be the ones to improve, extend, and save human life ENDEND  They could be the healers ENDEND 
As this new century unfolds, their success and your potential have led us to a moment of unparalleled promise in health and medicine ENDEND  Just like a century ago, technology and treatments that were once barely imagined are now imminently possible ENDEND 
Yet, while these are some of tomorrow's biggest potential breakthroughs, they are not today's biggest medical challenge ENDEND  Today, as we continue to find new ways to live longer and better, the greatest single threat to the health of our nation is not a scarcity of genius or a failure of discovery; it is a lack of collective will to ensure that every single American has access to effective, affordable health care ENDEND  It is our inability, after years and years of talk and gridlock, to finally do something about the crushing cost of health care in America ENDEND 
This has long stopped being about a single issue that politicians bring up during an election year ENDEND  This is now a national crisis ENDEND 
 million Americans are uninsured  over  million more in the last four years ENDEND  This isn't just a moral shame, it's an economic disaster that's catching Americans in a vicious cycle ENDEND  Because the uninsured can't afford health care, they put off seeing a doctor or end up in the ER when they get sick ENDEND  Then their care is more expensive, and so premiums for all Americans go up  to the tune of  a family ENDEND  Because everyone's premiums go up, more Americans lose their health care ENDEND 
All the while, costs just keep climbing and climbing ENDEND  Family premiums are up by nearly  over the last five years ENDEND  Deductibles are up  ENDEND  Copayments for care and prescriptions are through the roof ENDEND  From the smallest mom and pop stores to major corporations like GM, businesses who can't afford these rising costs cut back on insurance, workers, or both ENDEND  States with bigger Medicaid bills and smaller budgets are being forced to choose whether they want their citizens to be unhealthy or uneducated ENDEND  And over half of all family bankruptcies today are caused by medical bills ENDEND 
The cost crisis is affecting your profession too ENDEND  Whether it's Medicaid reimbursements, the rising price of medical malpractice insurance, or having HMOs look over your shoulder, all the hard work and sacrifice you've put in during medical school isn't as rewarding as it once was ENDEND 
So now, just like generations before, you must dare to believe  not only as tomorrow's physicians, but as tomorrow's parents, workers, business owners, and citizens ENDEND  You must choose: Will the groundbreaking miracles you discover over the next generation reach only the luckiest few? Or will history look back at this moment as the time when we finally made care available at a cost that won't bring the world's largest economy to its knees?
For you guys, this is about more than just the statistics and the numbers ENDEND  Part of the philosophy of the Pritzker School of Medicine has always been the recognition that "medicine does not exist in a social vacuum ENDEND " Living here over the last four years, you've seen this ENDEND  Surrounding us right now on the south side of Chicago are poor kids sitting in those ERs who could never afford a physical ENDEND  Children suffering from adult diabetes because parents can't afford to provide the proper nutrition ENDEND  Worried mothers thumbing through checkbooks, not knowing if they can pay for this month's medicine ENDEND 
There isn't one person sitting here today who wants to turn a sick patient away because they can't pay ENDEND  Not one person who wants the cure they discover denied to those whose lives depend on it ENDEND  Each of you has dedicated yourselves to this calling because where there is a sick person, you want to heal them ENDEND  Where there is a life in jeopardy, you want to save it ENDEND 
And so today, when you leave here, it will not only be with great knowledge, but with even greater responsibility ENDEND  Because if we do nothing about the rising cost of health care, experts believe that in ten years, the number of uninsured will grow to  million ENDEND  And if we do nothing to expand access to the uninsured, costs will keep rising ENDEND 
But while this is a national crisis, it still isn't part of the national conversation ENDEND  It's an issue where we haven't seen any leadership over the last four years; an issue that Washington continues to duck ENDEND  We just spent three entire weeks arguing over the filibuster, but I can count on one hand the number of times we've talked about health care since I was sworn in last January ENDEND  Yet, when I come back here and talk to families in Illinois, that's all they tell me about ENDEND 
This isn't just limited to one party either ENDEND  In part, the fear of reform stems from the experience President Clinton had in the early 's when he recognized the emerging health care crisis and sought a comprehensive answer ENDEND  For that, he deserves great credit ENDEND 
But the resulting political firestorm, fanned by the insurance lobby and other powerful interests who had a stake in maintaining the status quo, badly singed the Clinton Administration ENDEND 
Since then, health care continues to be fodder for candidates, but quickly recedes into the background when elections come and go ENDEND 
And with each passing year, the problem grows and the solutions become more difficult ENDEND 
We cannot turn our heads any longer ENDEND 
Challenging as it is, fixing the health care system is not an impossible problem to solve ENDEND  I'm not saying it will be easy, or that all the solutions are right in front of us ENDEND  We may not be able to build consensus on every detail right away, but where we do agree, we should act now to bring down skyrocketing costs ENDEND 
One place to start is by bringing the health care system into the st century ENDEND  In our lifetimes, we've seen some of the greatest advances in the history of technology and the sharing of information ENDEND  Yet, you're about to enter a profession where too much care is still provided with a pen and paper ENDEND  Where too much information about patients isn't shared between doctors or readily available to them in the first place ENDEND  And where we still don't have the information to know what care has worked most effectively and efficiently to make patients healthy ENDEND 
For too many Americans, the time lost as a result of archaic recordkeeping has been the margin between life and death ENDEND 
But embracing st century technology is not just about reducing errors and improving the quality of medical care ENDEND  It's also about cost ENDEND 
We spend nearly one and a half trillion dollars a year on health care in America ENDEND  But a quarter of that money  one out of every four dollars  is spent on nonmedical costs; most of it bills and paperwork ENDEND  Nearly every other industry in the world has saved billions on these administrative costs by doing it all online ENDEND  Every transaction you make at a bank now costs them less than a penny ENDEND  Even at the Veterans Administration, where it used to cost nine dollars to pull up your medical record, new technology means you can call up the same record on the internet for free ENDEND 
Yet, because we haven't updated technology in the rest of the health care industry, a single transaction still costs up to twentyfive dollars  not one dime of which goes toward improving the quality of our health care ENDEND  Doctors are forced to fumble through paperwork and don't have all of the information about each patient at the click of a mouse ENDEND  Mistakes are easily made and today, patients are given the right kind of care only half of the time ENDEND  In fact, a recent study showed that medical error alone kills up to , people a year  that's more than die from AIDS each year ENDEND  This is due not only to outdated medical technology, but the fact that we don't have a health care system that measures the quality of care patients are provided  that tells us what works, what doesn't, and where mistakes were made ENDEND 
But by bringing our health care system online, we could start improving the quality of care and cutting the cost of it ENDEND  We could save thousands of lives and save families billions of dollars ENDEND  Just imagine if every doctor and nurse could sit by a patient's bedside with a laptop and pull up their entire medical history  information from every past doctor they've seen  with the click of a mouse ENDEND  If every patient had an electronic bracelet that you could scan to find out the exact type and amount of medication they needed so there were no mistakes made ENDEND  If you could go online and monitor a patient's breathing and heart rate while they were home to track their recovery ENDEND 
We know all of this possible  so what are we waiting for? It's time for this country to start taking on the big challenges and asking the big questions again ENDEND  Why couldn't we help every health care provider who does business with the federal government that they need to convert their entire system to electronic transactions? Why couldn't we help connect our hospitals so they could share technology and information about what works and what doesn't? This way we could start creating a virtual system of health care in America where knowledge about each individual's health needs and health history is readily available to every single person who provides them care ENDEND 
And while we're at it, why couldn't we start rewarding the quality of care and the effort to prevent disease instead of only rewarding treatment itself? This way there would be actual incentives to provide good care and it would cut down on wasteful spending on the wrong kind of care ENDEND  As tomorrow's doctors, you can help here too by making sure that all the drugs you prescribe aren't just the latest pharmaceutical fad, but the cheapest and most effective medicine for your patients ENDEND 
So why couldn't we do all of this? The answer is, we can ENDEND  We can bring down the cost of health care in America and insure every American, and your generation can lead the way ENDEND 
Of course, no one's forcing you to meet these challenges ENDEND  Each of you has been blessed with extraordinary gifts and talent ENDEND  And so if you want, you can leave here and focus on your own medical career and your own success, not giving another thought to the plight of the growing millions who can't afford the care you will provide ENDEND  After all, there is no community service requirement in the real world; and no one's forcing you to care ENDEND 
But I hope that you do ENDEND  Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt ENDEND  Not because you have an obligation to those are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation ENDEND  You need to take on the challenges that your country is facing because you have an obligation to yourself ENDEND  Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation ENDEND  Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential ENDEND 
Looking out at this class of , I think my hope is wellplaced ENDEND  With the field you have chosen, you've already shown how much you care about the lives of others; how strongly you have heard the calling to be healers in this world ENDEND  Today, I ask you to remember that call always, and to remember how it could include more than the patient sitting in your office ENDEND  It could also include the patients who can't afford to get there, the ones who aren't being provided the best care, and the general health of all Americans ENDEND 
When you think about these challenges, I also ask you to remember that in this country, our history of overcoming the seemingly impossible always comes about because individuals who care really can make a difference ENDEND  America is great because Americans are good ENDEND 
And as you go forth from here in your own life, you can keep this history alive if you only find the courage to try ENDEND  Good luck with this journey, and congratulations on all of your achievements ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 
The other day I had the opportunity to visit some of our wounded heroes at Walter Reed Army Medical Center ENDEND 
I know that many of my colleagues have made the same trip and I'd heard about their visits, but there is nothing that can fully prepare you for what you see when you take that first step into the Physical Therapy room ENDEND 
These are kids in there ENDEND  Our kids ENDEND  The ones we watched grow up ENDEND  The ones we hoped would live lives that were happy, healthy, and safe ENDEND  These kids left their homes and families for a dangerous place halfway around the world ENDEND  After years of being protected by their parents, these kids risked their lives to protect us ENDEND 
And now, some of them have come home from that war with scars that may change their lives forever  scars that may never heal ENDEND  And yet they sit there in that hospital, so full of hope and still so proud of their country ENDEND 
These kids are the best of America ENDEND  They deserve our highest respect, and they deserve our help ENDEND 
Recently, I learned that some of our most severely wounded soldiers are being forced to pay for their own meals and their own phone calls while being treated in medical hospitals ENDEND 
Up until last year, there was a law on the books that prohibited soldiers from receiving both their basic subsistence allowance and free meals from the military ENDEND  Basically, this law allowed the government to charge our wounded heroes for food while they were recovering from their war injuries ENDEND 
Thankfully, this body acted to change this law in  so that wounded soldiers wouldn't have to pay for their meals ENDEND 
But, we're dealing with a bureaucracy here, and as we all know, nothing is ever simple in a bureaucracy ENDEND  So now, because the Department of Defense doesn't consider getting physical therapy or rehabilitation services in a medical hospital as "being hospitalized," there are wounded veterans who still do not qualify for the free meals other veterans receive ENDEND  And after  days, even those classified as hospitalized on an outpatient status lose their free meals as well ENDEND 
Also, while our soldiers in the field qualify for free phone service, injured service men and women who may be hospitalized hundreds or thousands of miles from home do not receive this benefit ENDEND 
For soldiers whose family members aren't able to take off work and travel to a military hospital, hearing the familiar voice of a mom or dad or husband or wife on the other side of the phone can make all the difference in the world ENDEND 
And yet, our government will not help pay for these calls ENDEND  And it will not help pay for those meals ENDEND 
Think about that ENDEND  Think about the sacrifice these kids have made for their country, many of them literally risking life and sacrificing limb ENDEND 
And now, at  ENDEND  a meal, they could end up with a  bill from the government that sent them to war every single month ENDEND  This is wrong, and we have a moral obligation to fix it ENDEND 
The first amendment that I'm offering today will do this ENDEND  It will expand the group of "hospitalized" soldiers who cannot be charged for their meals to include those service members undergoing medical recuperation, therapy or otherwise on "medical hold ENDEND " The number of people affected by this amendment will be small ENDEND  Only about  service members are estimated to fall under the category of "nonhospitalized ENDEND "
The amendment is retroactive to January , , in an effort to provide those injured service members who may have received bills for their meals with some relief from those costs ENDEND  The amendment will also extend free phone service to those injured service members who are hospitalized or otherwise undergoing medical recuperation or therapy ENDEND  I am proud that this amendement is supported by the American Legion, and I hope my colleagues will join them in that support ENDEND 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment ENDEND  These are our kids out there, and they're risking their lives for us ENDEND  When they come home with injuries, the government that asked these kids to serve should provide them with the best possible care and support ENDEND  This is a small price to pay for those who have sacrificed so much for their country ENDEND 
I thank the Senior Senator from Alaska and my colleague from Mississippi for working with me on this issue ENDEND  I am hopeful we can reach an agreement on this ENDEND 

Let me congratulate all of those who have helped to make this wonderful vision a reality ENDEND 
But we gather here today not to celebrate a building ENDEND  We gather to celebrate a man ENDEND 
What is it that makes Lincoln such a seminal figure in our story? How is it that this man, born in the backwoods of Kentucky, with little formal education, homely and awkward, a man given to depression and wracked with selfdoubt, might come to represent so much of who we are as a people, and so much of what we aspire to be?
Some of it has to do with the trajectory of his life ENDEND  In his rise from poverty, his selfstudy and ultimate mastery of language and of law, in his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of repeated defeat  in all of this we see a fundamental element of the American character, a belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams ENDEND 
Some of it has to do with the sheer energy of the man, the railsplitter, axinhand, looking out at a frontier of hope and possibility ENDEND  Lincoln believed deeply in the American spirit of innovation and exploration that accepts no limits to the heights to which our nation might reach ENDEND 
In all of this  the repeated acts of selfcreation, the insistence that with sweated brow and calloused hands and focused will we can recast the wilderness of the American landscape and the American heart into something better, something finer  in all of this Lincoln embodies our deepest myths ENDEND  It is a mythology that drives us still ENDEND 
And yet what separates Lincoln from the other great men has to do with something else ENDEND  It's an issue of character that speaks to us, of moral resolve ENDEND  Lincoln was not a perfect man, nor a perfect president ENDEND  By modern standards, his condemnation of slavery might be considered tentative; his Emancipation Proclamation more a military document than a clarion call for justice ENDEND  He wasn't immune to political considerations; his temperament could be indecisive and morose ENDEND 
And yet despite these imperfections, despite his fallibility ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND indeed, perhaps because of a painful selfawareness of his own failings, etched in every crease of his face and reflected in those haunted eyes ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND because of this essential humanity of his, when it came time to confront the greatest moral challenge this nation has ever faced, Lincoln did not flinch ENDEND  He did not equivocate or duck or pass the challenge on to future generations ENDEND  He did not demonize the fathers and sons who did battle on the other side, nor seek to diminish the terrible costs of his war ENDEND  In the midst of slavery's dark storm and the complexities of governing a house divided, he kept his moral compass pointed firm and true ENDEND 
It serves us then to reflect on whether that element of Lincoln's character, and the American character  that aspect which makes tough choices, and speaks the truth when least convenient, and acts while still admitting doubt  remains with us today ENDEND  Lincoln once said that "character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow ENDEND  The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing ENDEND "
At a time when image all too often trumps substance, when our politics all too often feeds rather than bridges division, when the prospects of a poor youth rising out of poverty seem of no consequence to the powerful, and when we evoke our common God to condemn those who do not think as we do, rather than to seek God's mercy for our own lack of understanding  at such a time it is helpful to remember this man who was the real thing ENDEND  Lincoln reminds us that our essential greatness is not the shadow of sophistication or popularity, or wealth or power or fleeting celebrity ENDEND  It is the tree that stands in the face of our doubts and fears and bigotries, and insists we can do better ENDEND 
Today we come to celebrate not a building but a man ENDEND  And as that man called once upon the better angels of our nature, so is he calling still, across the ages, to summon some measure of that character, his character, in each of us, today ENDEND 

Thank you ENDEND  It's always great to be here in Carbondale, and a real honor to speak here at SIUC's first Agriculture Industry Day ENDEND 
Now, I'll be honest  I haven't done all that much farming living on the South Side of Chicago ENDEND  But I have to say, my fondest farming memory is when I once offered to help out a friend with his harvest ENDEND  Knowing the full range of my agricultural experience and expertise, he took one look at me and said ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND "no thanks ENDEND "
So when I saw that you guys needed a keynote speaker for a lecture entitled, "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois," I said "sign me up ENDEND "
But seriously, while I don't farm, what I did do during my eight years in the Illinois State Senate, and what I'm doing now as a Senator in Washington, is to constantly listen and learn from people who do farm and who do know the business ENDEND  And that has helped me tremendously in figuring out how I can best stand up and speak out on the issues that matter to family farmers and to the future of agriculture in this country ENDEND 
Thanks to all the hard work you're doing here at SIU, that future holds more promise and more potential for America with each passing day ENDEND  Because in a world where globalization has made it possible for a student in Carbondale to share ideas with one in Calcutta, yet necessary for them to compete for the same jobs, the advances you're making in agriculture could lead to the breakthroughs we need to maintain America's global leadership in the years to come ENDEND 
This is our new challenge for the new century  and it's different than anything we've ever faced before ENDEND 
Just think about what the world was like only fifty years ago, when the College of Agriculture was a small, fiveman department that taught its students in a few old army barracks ENDEND  Back then, the big challenge was navigating the soils found in the hills and valleys of southern Illinois ENDEND  If you could master that, you were ready to graduate and live the farming life, knowing that it would be enough to provide for you and your family ENDEND 
And even if you didn't go to a fine school like SIU, in those days you still had a shot at the American Dream ENDEND  Because whether it was on the farm or in a factory, a middleclass job that paid a decent wage and good benefits was easy to come by  and it would probably last you a lifetime ENDEND  Hard work and sacrifice paid off for most families, and because of the wealth they built, America's economic leadership was unchallenged ENDEND 
But the world has certainly changed since then, hasn't it?
Today, even a college degree doesn't guarantee a middleclass job that will support a family ENDEND  What's worse, the cost of getting that degree and the price of health care on that job are rising higher and faster than ever before ENDEND  Family farmers are being squeezed by big agribusiness, and factory jobs are heading across the ocean where labor is cheap ENDEND 
We can make sure that the new jobs and new industries that take their place stay in America  but it won't happen by itself ENDEND  Countries like India and China are churning out more and more qualified college graduates who can compete directly with Americans for jobs that can now be done anywhere in the world ENDEND  If we want to stay on top, we'll need a nationwide commitment to better education, better training, and the research and discovery that have always made America a land of innovation and optimism ENDEND 
This is where you guys come in ENDEND 
The title of this lecture  "Growing the Food, Agriculture, and Natural Resource Economy in Southern Illinois"  is really too narrow to capture the full potential of the work you're doing here at the College of Agriculture ENDEND  Fifty years ago, it may have only been about the economy in southern Illinois ENDEND  Fifty years ago, the work you're doing may not have had an impact beyond the farms and borders of a small town like Carbondale ENDEND 
But today we live in a different world ENDEND 
Today, a discovery made right here in your Food and Nutrition department could save a person from a lifetime of diabetes in southern California ENDEND  An SIU student who publishes a paper online about the benefits of soy in preventing prostate cancer could attract the attention of a researcher in Boston who's working on a cure ENDEND  And a professor who makes a breakthrough in developing droughtresistant crops could save millions from hunger in Africa ENDEND 
Today, the work you're doing here not only has the potential to improve the lives of people in Illinois and across the world; it offers the opportunity to develop new ideas that will lead to new jobs and a new competitive edge for America in the st century ENDEND  This is the way we can win in the global economy, and here at this school in this Illinois small town, you're helping us get there ENDEND 
Right now, researchers at this college are studying ways to improve the production and efficiency of ethanol ENDEND  Again, this may sound small, but just imagine what this could do for our country ENDEND 
Any of you who've pulled into a gas station lately have noticed how high the prices are getting ENDEND  You might have decided to drive your car less, or you might have noticed that the cost of gas is cutting into your family budget ENDEND  The price of oil has now climbed to a record of over  a barrel, and we don't even know how much worse it's going to get ENDEND 
So what do we do about this?
We only have  of the world's oil reserves   of our oil is imported from the Middle East ENDEND  So unless we want to stay dependent forever on a region of the world that's dangerous, politically unstable, and willing to do lordknowswhat with the price of oil, we must find new sources of energy here in America ENDEND 
It seems like politicians have been saying this forever ENDEND  But when you look at the record gas prices, and the possibility for more war and turmoil in the Middle East, it's clear that we need less talk and more action ENDEND 
We can start by producing more ethanol in America ENDEND 
The future of energy in this country doesn't have to remain in the deserts of the Middle East; we can find it in the corn fields of Illinois and across the Midwest ENDEND 
Imagine running our cars with a fuel we can literally grow as much as we want of ENDEND  Imagine using a fuel that's clean and healthy, that's selling for  cents cheaper than gasoline, and that places America's energy needs in America's hands ENDEND 
This kind of future is here  but to expand ethanol's promise across the nation, you guys need to keep up the great research here and we need to step up the legislative process in Washington ENDEND 
Recently, I joined a few other Senators in introducing a bill that would increase America's renewable fuel standard and increase ethanol production along with it ENDEND  A bill like this that's already passed the Senate twice would've provided us with , barrels a day of refined ethanol for use in gasoline and would save us  billion every year in imported oil and gasoline costs ENDEND 
Just think of what this would do for our economy ENDEND  Farmers would earn more for their corn, businesses would invest more in the type of communitysized ethanol facilities that would grow the downstate economy, and over , jobs would be created ENDEND  We've got bipartisan support for this bill, so I'm pretty confident that this is the year we're finally going to get it done ENDEND 
The other ethanol bill I've introduced would make it easier for more cars to be powered by cheaper, cleaner, ethanolbased fuel ENDEND  As most of you probably know, there's a fuel known as E that's made from  ethanol and  gasoline ENDEND  It's a great alternative to gasoline, but the only problem is that we're in short supply of E fueling stations ENDEND  Down here in southern Illinois, you drive by miles and miles of corn fields that can produce ethanol, but only  E stations in all of southern Illinois, and not one in Carbondale ENDEND  So the bill I'm sponsoring would provide a tax credit of  to anyone who wants to build an E fuel station ENDEND  And to give consumers a good deal too, it'll provide a tax credit of  cents per gallon of E fuel ENDEND  We've talked for too long about energy independence in this country, and I think these proposals finally give us an opportunity to do something about it ENDEND  You've all been doing your part here at SIU, and it's high time for Washington to do our part ENDEND 
I've always believed that the incredible story of progress that is America has been built by those who ask why, what if, and why not  questions asked by the very students at this college every day they choose to confront the challenges of this new century ENDEND  It is this fundamental character of the American spirit  the desire to move forward, look around the next corner, and reach for the unreachable  that put the first man on the moon, led to a cure for polio, and launched the technological revolution of the nineties ENDEND 
And as the College of Agriculture looks ahead to its next fifty years, we'd do well to ask ourselves "What will they say about us at the th anniversary?" As we face a new and different world that brings both great promise and great peril, what will we do move America towards a new and better day?
You won't find the answers from your professors  and certainly not from politicians ENDEND  You'll find them by continuing to ask yourselves those questions  why, what if, and why not ENDEND  And as you keep studying and researching here at school, remember that the answers you discover will not only have an impact where you live and learn, but across a world that is just waiting to hear from the next generation of dreamers ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

I rise today to speak on the nomination of California Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ENDEND  Now, let me begin by saying that the last thing I would like to be spending my time on right now is talking about judges ENDEND 
I am sure that is true for many in this Chamber ENDEND  I know that I certainly do not hear about filibusters and judges when I go back to Illinois and hold townhall meetings with people across the State ENDEND  What I hear about are veterans who are concerned about their disability payments and families who are talking about how high gas prices were or how difficult it is to pay for college ENDEND  And so I think this argument we have been having over the last several weeks about judicial nominations has been an enormous distraction from some of the work that is most important to the American people ENDEND 
Moreover, I am not so naive as to think that speaking to an empty Chamber for the benefit of CSPAN is somehow going to change people's minds or people's votes ENDEND  I recognize that most of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, are fairly locked into their positions ENDEND  I do not expect the President to appoint many judges of my liking ENDEND  One of the things I have told some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle is that there is only one sure way to make sure Democrats are able to block what they consider to be bad judges, and that is to win elections ENDEND 
And yet I feel compelled to rise on this issue to express, in the strongest terms, my opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the DC Circuit ENDEND 
I think it is important for the American people to know just what it is we are getting ENDEND  After the Supreme Court, as my esteemed colleague from Wisconsin just stated, the DC Circuit is widely viewed as the second highest court in the land ENDEND  Three of our current Supreme Court Justices came directly from this court ENDEND  Under its jurisdiction fall laws relating to all sorts of Federal agencies and regulations ENDEND  This is a special court ENDEND  It has jurisdiction that other appeals courts do not have ENDEND  The judges on this court are entrusted with the power to make decisions affecting the health of the environment, the amount of money we allow in politics, the right of workers to bargain for fair wages and find freedom from discrimination, and the Social Security that our seniors will receive ENDEND  It is because of this power that we deserve to give the American people a qualified judicial nominee to serve on the DC Circuit ENDEND 
Now, the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not simply whether they are intelligent ENDEND  Some of us who attended law school or are in business know there are a lot of real smart people out there whom you would not put in charge of stuff ENDEND  The test of whether a judge is qualified to be a judge is not their intelligence ENDEND  It is their judgment ENDEND 
The test of a qualified judicial nominee is also not whether that person has their own political views ENDEND  Every jurist surely does ENDEND  The test is whether he or she can effectively subordinate their views in order to decide each case on the facts and the merits alone ENDEND  That is what keeps our judiciary independent in America ENDEND  That is what our Founders intended ENDEND 
Unfortunately, as has been stated repeatedly on this floor, in almost every legal decision that she has made and every political speech that she has given, Justice Brown has shown she is not simply a judge with very strong political views, she is a political activist who happens to be a judge ENDEND  It is a pretty easy observation to make when you look at her judicial decisions ENDEND  While some judges tend to favor an activist interpretation of the law and others tend to believe in a restrained interpretation of the law providing great deference to the legislature, Justice Brown tends to favor whatever interpretation leads her to the very same ideological conclusions every single time ENDEND 
So when it comes to laws protecting a woman's right to choose or a worker's right to organize, she will claim that the laws that the legislature passed should be interpreted narrowly ENDEND  Yet when it comes to laws protecting corporations and private property, she has decided that those laws should be interpreted broadly ENDEND  When the rights of the vulnerable are at stake, then she believes the majority has the right to do whatever it wants ENDEND  When the minority happens to be the minority of people who have privilege and wealth, then suddenly she is countermajoritarian and thinks it is very important to constrain the will of the majority ENDEND 
Let me just give you a couple examples ENDEND  In a case reviewing California's parental notification law, Justice Brown criticized the California Supreme Court decision overturning that law, saying that the court should have remained "tentative, recognizing the primacy of legislative prerogatives ENDEND " She has also repeatedly tried to overturn the fact that California law recognizes Tameny claims, a line of cases that establishes that an employer does not have an unfettered right to fire an employee, but that the right has limits according to fundamental public policy ENDEND  She says judicial restraint is critical ENDEND  She claims that public policy is "a function first and foremost reserved to the legislature ENDEND "
So on these cases dealing with a woman's right to choose, worker protections, punitive damages, or discrimination, she wants the judge to stay out of the legislative decisionmaking process ENDEND  But Justice Brown doesn't always want the courts to exercise restraint and defer to the legislature ENDEND  When Justice Brown wanted to limit the ability of juries to punish companies that engage in severe discrimination, a fellow judge on the California Supreme Court accused her of engaging in "judicial law making ENDEND " Instead of denying it, Justice Brown defended her judicial activism ENDEND  She called it creativity ENDEND  This is what she said: "All judges make law ENDEND  It is arrogance, carelessness and a lack of candor that constitute impermissible judicial practice, not creativity ENDEND "
Justice Brown has also gone out of her way to use her position in the courts to advocate for increased protections for property owners ENDEND  In a case about a developer that wanted to break a city rent control law, Justice Brown dismissed the fact that a majority of the city's voters had approved of that law and thought that the case should be an exception to the philosophy of narrow judicial review ENDEND  Justice Brown believed that this case was one in which "some degree of judicial scrutiny ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND  is appropriate ENDEND " Which is it, Justice Brown? In some cases you think we should defer to the legislature and in some cases, apparently, you think it is appropriate for judges to make law ENDEND  What seems to distinguish these two types of cases is who the plaintiff is, who the claimant is ENDEND 
If the claimant is powerful  if they are a property owner, for example  then she is willing to use any tool in her judicial arsenal to make sure the outcome is one they like ENDEND  If it is a worker or a minority claiming discrimination, then she is nowhere to be found ENDEND 
Judicial decisions ultimately have to be based on evidence and on fact ENDEND  They have to be based on precedent and on law ENDEND  When you bend and twist all of these to cramp them into a conclusion you have already made  a conclusion that is based on your own personal ideology  you do a disservice to the ideal of an independent judiciary and to the American people who count on an independent judiciary ENDEND 
Because of this tendency, and because of her record, it seems as if Justice Brown's mission is not blind justice but political activism ENDEND  The only thing that seems to be consistent about her overarching judicial philosophy in an unyielding belief in an unfettered free market and a willingness to consistently side with the powerful over the powerless ENDEND 
Let's look at some of her speeches outside of the courtroom ENDEND  In speech after speech, she touts herself as a true conservative who believes that safety nets  such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, and health care  have "cut away the very foundation upon which the Constitution rests ENDEND "
Justice Brown believes, as has already been stated in the Chamber, that the New Deal, which helped save our country and get it back on its feet after the Great Depression, was a triumph of our very own "Socialist revolution ENDEND " She has equated altruism with communism ENDEND  She equates even the most modest efforts to level life's playing field with somehow inhibiting our liberty ENDEND 
For those who pay attention to legal argument, one of the things that is most troubling is Justice Brown's approval of the Lochner era of the Supreme Court ENDEND  In the Lochner case, and in a whole series of cases prior to Lochner being overturned, the Supreme Court consistently overturned basic measures like minimum wage laws, child labor safety laws, and rights to organize, deeming those laws as somehow violating a constitutional right to private property ENDEND  The basic argument in Lochner was you can't regulate the free market because it is going to constrain people's use of their private property ENDEND  Keep in mind that that same judicial philosophy was the underpinning of Dred Scott, the ruling that overturned the Missouri Compromise and said that it was unconstitutional to forbid slavery from being imported into the free States ENDEND  That same judicial philosophy essentially stopped every effort by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to overcome the enormous distress and suffering that occurred during the Great Depression ENDEND  It was ultimately overturned because Justices, such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, realized that if Supreme Court Justices can overturn any economic regulation  Social Security, minimum wage, basic zoning laws, and so forth  then they would be usurping the rights of a democratically constituted legislature ENDEND  Suddenly they would be elevated to the point where they were in charge as opposed to democracy being in charge ENDEND 
Justice Brown, from her speeches, at least, seems to think overturning Lochner was a mistake ENDEND  She believes the Supreme Court should be able to overturn minimum wage laws ENDEND  She thinks we should live in a country where the Federal Government cannot enforce the most basic regulations of transparency in our security markets, that we cannot maintain regulations that ensure our food is safe and the drugs that are sold to us have been tested ENDEND  It means, according to Justice Brown, that local governments or municipalities cannot enforce basic zoning regulations that relieve traffic, no matter how much damage it may be doing a particular community ENDEND 
What is most ironic about this is that what Justice Brown is calling for is precisely the type of judicial activism that conservatives have been railing against for the last  years ENDEND 
Supreme Court Justice Scalia is not somebody with whom I frequently agree ENDEND  I do not like a lot of his judicial approaches, but at least the guy is consistent ENDEND  Justice Scalia says that, generally speaking, the legislature has the power to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution ENDEND  That is not Justice Brown's philosophy ENDEND  It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right to do what you want with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom ENDEND  Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document ENDEND 
It would be one thing if these opinions were confined to her political speeches ENDEND  The fact is she has carried them over into her judicial decisionmaking ENDEND  That is why the California State Bar Association rated her as "unqualified" to serve on the State's highest court ENDEND  That is why not one member of the American Bar Association found her to be very qualified to serve on the DC Circuit, and why many members of the bar association found her not qualified at all ENDEND 
It is also why conservative commentators, such as Andrew Sullivan and George Will, while agreeing with her political philosophy, simply do not see how she can be an effective judge ENDEND  Here is what Sullivan said:
She does not fit the description of a judge who simply follows the law ENDEND  If she isn't a "judicial activist," I don't know who would be ENDEND 
Sullivan added that he is in agreement with some of her conservative views but thinks "she should run for office, not the courts ENDEND "
Columnist George Will, not known to be a raving liberal, added recently that he believes Justice Brown is out of the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence ENDEND 
Let me wrap up by making mention of a subtext to this debate ENDEND  As was true with Clarence Thomas, as was true with Alberto Gonzales, as was true with Condoleezza Rice, my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of time during this debate discussing Justice Brown's humble beginnings as a child of a sharecropper ENDEND  They like to point out she was the first African American to serve on the California Supreme Court ENDEND 
I, too, am an admirer of Justice Brown's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Alberto Gonzales's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Clarence Thomas's rise from modest means, just as I am an admirer of Condoleezza Rice's rise from modest means ENDEND  I think it is wonderful ENDEND  We should all be grateful where opportunity has opened the doors of success for Americans of every background ENDEND 
Moreover, I am not somebody who subscribes to the view that because somebody is a member of a minority group they somehow have to subscribe to a particular ideology or a particular political party ENDEND  I think it is wonderful that Asian Americans, Latinos, African Americans, and others are represented in all parties and across the political spectrum ENDEND  When such representation exists, then those groups are less likely to be taken for granted by any political party ENDEND 
I do not think that because Justice Brown is an AfricanAmerican woman she has to adhere to a particular political orthodoxy, something that has been suggested by the other side of the aisle ENDEND  Just as it would be cynical and offensive that Justice Brown be vilified simply for being a Black conservative, it is equally offensive and cynical to suggest that somehow she should get a pass for her outlandish views simply because she is a Black woman ENDEND 
I hope we have arrived at a point in our country's history where Black folks can be criticized for holding views that are out of the mainstream, just as Whites are criticized when they hold views that are out of the mainstream ENDEND  I hope we have come to the point where a woman can be criticized for being insensitive to the rights of women, just as men are criticized when they are insensitive to the rights of women ENDEND 
Unfortunately, Justice Brown's record on privacy and employment discrimination indicates precisely such an insensitivity ENDEND 
I will give one example ENDEND  In a case where a group of Latino employees at Avis Rent A Car was subjected to repeated racial slurs in the workplace by another employee, the lower court found that Avis, in allowing this to go on, had created a hostile environment ENDEND  Justice Brown disagreed with and criticized the decision ENDEND 
In her opinion, she wrote that racially discriminatory speech in the workplace, even when it rises to the level of illegal race discrimination, is still protected by the first amendment ENDEND  This was despite United States   Supreme Court opinions that came to the exact opposite conclusion ENDEND 
Justice Brown went so far as to suggest that the landmark civil rights law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of , could be unconstitutional under the first amendment ENDEND 
I believe if the American people could truly see what was going on here they would oppose this nomination, not because she is African American, not because she is a woman, but because they fundamentally disagree with a version of America she is trying to create from her position on the bench ENDEND  It is social Darwinism, a view of America that says there is not a problem that cannot be solved by making sure that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer ENDEND  It requires no sacrifice on the part of those of us who have won life's lottery and does not consider who our parents were or the education received or the right breaks that came at the right time ENDEND 
Today, at a time when American families are facing more risk and greater insecurity than they have in recent history, at a time when they have fewer resources and a weaker safety net to protect them against those insecurities, people of all backgrounds in America want a nation where we share life's risks and rewards with each other ENDEND  And when they make laws that will spread this opportunity to all who are willing to work for it, they expect our judges to uphold those laws, not tear them down because of their political predilections ENDEND  Republican, Democrat, or anyone in between ENDEND  Those are the types of judges the American people deserve ENDEND  Justice Brown is not one of those judges ENDEND  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this nomination ENDEND 

Thank you ENDEND  It's an honor to be here with the hundreds of dedicated librarians who make up the American Library Association ENDEND  Before we begin, I'd like to say a special hello to ALA member Nancy Gibbs, who is the mother of my communications director, Robert Gibbs ENDEND  Believe me, I have no idea how the biggest mouth in our office came from a family of two librarians, but we're proud to have him on board and I'm sure you are too ENDEND 
I'd also like to give a shoutout to my librarians from the Punahou School in Hawaii  Molly Lyman, Joan Kaaua, and Lillian Hiratani ENDEND  I'd like to offer them an apology too, for all those times I couldn't keep myself out of trouble and ended up sitting in their library on a timeout, trying to cause even more trouble there ENDEND  Sorry ladies ENDEND 
It is a pleasure to address you today because of what libraries represent ENDEND  More than a building that houses books and data, the library has always been a window to a larger world  a place where we've always come to discover big ideas and profound concepts that help move the American story forward ENDEND 
And at a time when truth and science are constantly being challenged by political agendas and ideologies; a time where so many refuse to teach evolution in our schools, where fake science is used to beat back attempts to curb global warming or fund lifesaving research; libraries remind us that truth isn't about who yells the loudest, but who has the right information ENDEND  Because even as we're the most religious of people, America's innovative genius has always been preserved because we also have a deep faith in facts ENDEND 
And so the moment we persuade a child, any child, to cross that threshold into a library, we've changed their lives forever, and for the better ENDEND  This is an enormous force for good ENDEND 
So I'm here to gratefully acknowledge the importance of libraries and the work you do ENDEND  I also want to work with you to insure that libraries continue to be sanctuaries for learning, where we are free to read and consider what we please, without the fear of Big Brother peering menacingly over our shoulders ENDEND 
Now, some of you might have heard about this speech I gave at the Democratic Convention last summer ENDEND  It ended up making some news here and there, and one of the lines that people seem to remember was when I said that "We don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States ENDEND "
What many people don't remember is that for years, librarians are the ones who've been on the frontlines of this fight for privacy and freedom ENDEND  There have always been dark times in our history where America has strayed from the ideals that make us a great nation ENDEND  But the question has always been, can we overcome? And you have always been a group of Americans who have answered a resounding "yes" to that question ENDEND 
When political groups try to censor great works of literature, you're the ones putting Huck Finn and Catcher in the Rye back on the shelves, making sure that our right to free thought and free information is protected ENDEND  And ever since we've had to worry about our own government looking over our shoulders in the library, you've been there to stand up and speak out on privacy issues ENDEND  You're fulltime defenders of the most fundamental American liberties, and for that, you deserve America's deepest gratitude ENDEND 
You also deserve our protection ENDEND  That's why I've been working with Republicans and Democrats to make sure we have a Patriot Act that helps us track down terrorists without trampling on our civil liberties ENDEND  This is an issue that Washington always tries to make "eitheror ENDEND " Either we protect our people from terror or we protect our most cherished principles ENDEND  But this kind of choice asks too little of us and assumes too little about America ENDEND  We can harness new technologies and a new toughness to find terrorists before they strike while still protecting the very freedoms we're fighting for in the first place ENDEND 
I know that some of you here have been subject to FBI or other law enforcement orders asking for reading records ENDEND  And so I hope we can pass a provision like the House of Representatives did that would require federal agents to get these kinds of search warrants from a real judge in a real court, just like everyone else does ENDEND  In the Senate, the bipartisan bill that we're working on, known as the SAFE Act, will prevent the federal government from freely rifling through emails and library records without first obtaining such a warrant ENDEND  Giving law enforcement the tools they need to investigate suspicious activity is one thing; but doing it without the approval of our judicial system seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for ENDEND 
Now, in addition to the line about federal agents poking around in our libraries, there was also another line in the convention speech that received a lot of attention  a line I'd like to talk more about today ENDEND  At one point in the speech, I mentioned that the people I've met all across Illinois know that government can't solve all their problems ENDEND  They know that, quote, " ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND parents have to parent, that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white ENDEND "
I included this line in the speech because I believe that we have a serious challenge to meet ENDEND  I believe that if we want to give our children the best possible chance in life; if we want to open doors of opportunity while they're young and teach them the skills they'll need to succeed later on, then one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens, as educators, and as parents is to ensure that every American child can read and read well ENDEND 
This isn't just another education debate where the answer lies somewhere between more money and less bureaucracy ENDEND  It's a responsibility that begins at home  one that we need to take on before our kids ever step foot in a classroom; one that we need to carry through well into their teenage years ENDEND 
That's because literacy is the most basic currency of the knowledge economy we're living in today ENDEND  Only a few generations ago, it was okay to enter the workforce as a high school dropout who could only read at a thirdgrade level ENDEND  Whether it was on a farm or in a factory, you could still hope to find a job that would allow you to pay the bills and raise your family ENDEND 
But that economy is long gone ENDEND  As revolutions in technology and communication began breaking down barriers between countries and connecting people all over the world, new jobs and industries that require more skill and knowledge have come to dominate the economy ENDEND  Whether it's software design or computer engineering or financial analysis, corporations can locate these jobs anywhere there's an internet connection ENDEND  And so as countries like China and India continue to modernize their economies and educate their children longer and better, the competition American workers face will grow more intense; the necessary skills more demanding ENDEND 
These new jobs are about what you know and how fast you can learn what you don't know ENDEND  They require innovative thinking, detailed comprehension, and superior communication ENDEND 
But before our children can even walk into an interview for one of these jobs; before they can ever fill out an application or earn the required college degree; they have to be able to pick up a book, read it, and understand it ENDEND  Nothing is more basic; no ability more fundamental ENDEND 
Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other learning possible, from complex word problems and the meaning of our history to scientific discovery and technological proficiency ENDEND  In a knowledge economy where this kind of learning is necessary for survival, how can we send our kids out into the world if they're only reading at a fourth grade level?
I don't know, but we do ENDEND  Day after day, year after year ENDEND 
Right now, one out of every five adults in the United States can't read a simple story to their child ENDEND  During the last twenty years or so, over ten million Americans reached the th grade without having learned to read at a basic level ENDEND 
But these literacy problems start far before high school ENDEND  In , only  of all fourth graders tested as reading proficient ENDEND  And the story gets worse when you take race and income into consideration ENDEND  Children from lowincome families score  points below the average reading level, while students from wealthy families score fifteen points above the average ENDEND  And while only one in twelve white seventeenyearolds has the ability to pick up the newspaper and understand the science section, for Hispanics the number jumps to one in fifty; for African Americans it's one in one hundred ENDEND 
In this new economy, teaching our kids just enough so that they can get through Dick and Jane isn't going to cut it ENDEND  Over the last ten years, the average literacy required for all American occupations is projected to rise by  ENDEND  It's not enough just to recognize the words on the page anymore  the kind of literacy necessary for st century employment requires detailed understanding and complex comprehension ENDEND  But too many kids simply aren't learning at that level ENDEND 
And yet, every year we pass more of these kids through school or watch as more dropout ENDEND  These kids who will pour through the Help Wanted section and cross off job and after job that requires skills they just don't have ENDEND  And others who will have to take that Help Wanted section, walk it over to someone else, and find the courage to ask, "Will you read this for me?"
We have to change our whole mindset in this country ENDEND  We're living in a st century knowledge economy, but our schools, our homes, and our culture are still based around th century expectations ENDEND  It might seem like we're doing kids a favor by teaching them just enough to count change and read a food label, but in this economy, it's doing them a huge disservice ENDEND  Instead, we need to start setting high standards and inspirational examples for our children to follow ENDEND  While there's plenty that can be done to improve our schools and reform education in America, this isn't just an issue where we can turn to the government and ask for help ENDEND  Reading has to begin at home ENDEND 
We know that children who start Kindergarten with an awareness of letters and basic language sounds become better readers and face fewer challenges in the years ahead ENDEND  We also know that the more reading material kids are exposed to at home, the better they score on reading tests throughout their lives ENDEND  So we need to make investments in family literacy programs and early childhood education so that kids aren't left behind before they even go to school ENDEND  And we need to get books in our kids' hands early and often ENDEND 
I know that this is often easier said than done ENDEND  Parents today still have the toughest job in the world  and no one ever thanks you enough for doing it ENDEND  You're working longer and harder than ever, juggling job and family responsibilities, and trying to be everywhere at once ENDEND  When you're home, you might try to get your kids to read, but you're competing with the other byproducts of the technological revolution: video games and DVDs that they just have to have; TVs in every room of the household ENDEND  Children eight to eighteen now spend three hours a day watching TV, while they only spend  minutes reading ENDEND 
Our kids aren't just seeing these temptations at home  they're everywhere ENDEND  Whether it's their friends or the people they see on TV or a general culture that glorifies antiintellectualism, it's too easy for kids today to put down a book and turn their attention elsewhere ENDEND  And it's too easy for the rest of us to make excuses for it  pretending that putting a baby in front of a DVD is educational, letting a twelveyearold skip reading as long as he's playing good video games, or substituting dinner in front of the TV for family conversation ENDEND 
We know that's not what our kids need ENDEND  We know that's not what's best for them ENDEND  And so as parents, we need to find the time and the energy to step in and find ways to help our kids love reading ENDEND  We can read to them, talk to them about what they're reading and make time for this by turning off the TV ourselves ENDEND 
Libraries can help parents with this ENDEND  Knowing the constraints we face from busy schedules and a TV culture, we need to think outside the box here  to dream big like we always have in America ENDEND  Right now, children come home from their first doctor's appointment with an extra bottle of formula ENDEND  But imagine if they came home with their first library card or their first copy of Goodnight Moon?
What if it was as easy to get a book as it is to rent a DVD or pick up McDonalds? What if instead of a toy in every Happy Meal, there was a book? What if there were portable libraries that rolled through parks and playgrounds like ice cream trucks? Or kiosks in stores where you could borrow books? What if during the summer, when kids often lose much of the reading progress they've made during the year, every child had a list of books they had to read and talk about and an invitation to a summer reading club at the local library?
Libraries have a special role to play in our knowledge economy ENDEND  Your institution has been and should be the place where parents and kids come to read together and learn together ENDEND  We should take our kids here more, and we should make sure politicians aren't closing libraries down because they had to spend a few extra bucks on tax cuts instead ENDEND 
Each of you has a role here too ENDEND  You can get more kids to walk through your doors by building on the ideas so many of you are already pursuing  book clubs and contests, homework help and advertising your services throughout the community ENDEND  In the years ahead, this is our challenge  and this must be our responsibility ENDEND 
As a librarian or as a parent, every one of you here today can probably remember the look on a child's face after finishing a first book ENDEND  They turn that last page and stare up at you with those wide eyes, and in that look you find such a sense of accomplishment and pride; of great potential and so much possibility ENDEND 
And in that moment, there's nothing we want more than to nurture that hope; to make all those possibilities and all those opportunities real for our children; to have the ability to answer the question, "What can I be when I grow up?" with "Anything you want  anything you can dream of ENDEND "
It's a hope that's as old as the American story itself ENDEND  From the moment the first immigrants arrived on these shores, generations of parents have worked hard and sacrificed whatever is necessary so that their children could have the same chances they had; or the chances they never had ENDEND  Because while we could never ensure that our children would be rich or successful; while we could never be positive that they would do better than their parents, America is about making it possible to give them the chance ENDEND  To give every child the opportunity to try ENDEND 
Education is still the foundation of this opportunity ENDEND  And the most basic building block that holds that foundation together is still reading ENDEND  At the dawn of the st century, in a world where knowledge truly is power and literacy is the skill that unlocks the gates of opportunity and success, we all have a responsibility as parents and librarians, educators and citizens, to instill in our children a love of reading so that we can give them the chance to fulfill their dreams ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

On Monday, I traveled from D ENDEND C ENDEND  to Chicago to witness a monumental event ENDEND  There were , people marching on behalf of comprehensive immigration reform in this country ENDEND  There were rallies all across the country but Chicago was one of the largest ENDEND  I had the opportunity to speak to the people who were gathering at Union Park before they marched over to Grant Park ENDEND  Fourhundred thousand people, mostly of Mexican origin, but large numbers of people from other countries  Nigerians and Pakistanis and Indians and Filipinos  people who've come to this country for the same reason that immigrants have been drawn to this country for generations: the notion that they can pursue and better life for themselves but, most importantly, for their children, if they work hard and apply themselves ENDEND 
I think most of you are familiar with the issues that have surrounded immigration ENDEND  They've gotten a lot of attention recently ENDEND  We have a system of legal immigration in which people are drawn through the normal processes and they apply for legal residency and ultimately get naturalized as citizens if they so choose ENDEND  The controversy right now surrounds undocumented workers  people who came here illegally, most of them crossing the border between Mexico and the United States ENDEND  It's estimated at this point that we probably have  to  million undocumented workers around the country ENDEND  Most of them are employed in lowwage backbreaking work in agricultural sectors, in packing plants, in restaurants, in construction ENDEND  Obviously, the country feels ambivalent about this influx ENDEND 
On the one hand, I think many of us  believe that these people are doing what any of us would do if we had an opportunity for a better life for our kids ENDEND  They take the risk of coming here; many of them are extraordinarily impoverished and would not likely be able to get to the United States through the limited number of visas that are currently issued ENDEND 
On the other hand, we are a nation of laws and these people did come here outside of the law ENDEND  Economists debate what kind of effect undocumented workers have in this country ENDEND  There's no doubt that in many areas, like the agricultural sector, these immigrants are doing work that Americans would not do, at least at the wages that are paid ENDEND  There are other circumstances in which it is clear that employers are importing these workers simply because they don't want to pay the living wages that Americans demand ENDEND  There is no doubt that if construction companies were willing to pay more that they would see more United States   workers applying for those jobs ENDEND  It does appear that undocumented workers have a somewhat adverse effect in depressing the wages of lowskill workers, which is why in the AfricanAmerican community, for example, there is some nervousness of about the number of undocumented workers that are coming into this country and whether they are systematically replacing or pushing out lowskill, lowwage black workers ENDEND 
Having said all that, I think we need to recognize that if we are going to uphold the traditions of this country as a nation of immigrants, than we are going to have to deal with this issue in a way that reflects common sense and compassion ENDEND 
The House of Representatives passed a bill that was extraordinarily punitive ENDEND  It talked about border security and it made any undocumented worker in this country a felon; it also made people who potentially helped undocumented workers, for example, providing housing assistance or providing a domestic violence shelter potentially subject to a felony conviction ENDEND 
It's that draconian measure that passed in the House that prompted these marches, but what started as a march of fear on the part of many undocumented workers, I think, has become a march for hope ENDEND  People are hoping that they have an opportunity to legalize themselves in some fashion ENDEND 
In the United States Senate there has been a bipartisan group, including myself, Ted Kennedy, John McCain, Chuck Hagel, Mel Martinez, Ken Salazar, Lindsey Graham and a number of others who've been trying to negotiate a comprehensive package that would include stronger border security, making sure that employers actually verify employment status through a tamperproof employeeverification card, and creation of a pathway to citizenship  earned citizenship  for the  to  million people that are already here ENDEND  The idea would be that those people, over the course of eleven years could earn their way to citizenship by paying a fine, paying their back taxes , staying out of trouble, learning English and so on ENDEND  The opponents of this kind of proposal call this amnesty and they hearken back to what happened in  when, in fact, undocumented workers were provided amnesty ENDEND  There was supposed to be a grand bargain where in exchange for such amnesty there was going to be serious border security and employer sanctions on those who had hired undocumented workers ENDEND  That never really happened ENDEND  And so people who are opposed to the Senate bill believe that the best strategy is not to provide amnesty to these undocumented workers but simply shut off the possibility that they can be hired, perhaps deport them where they can be rounded up and build either a virtual wall or a literal wall along the Mexican and United States borders ENDEND  That kind of approach just isn't realistic ENDEND  We're not going to deport  to  million people; many of them have been here for many years, many of them have strong roots, many of them have children who were born here and are therefore United States citizens ENDEND  It's hard to imagine that we want to live in a country where we would have police and immigration officials coming into people's homes and taking away the father of a family, sending him back to Mexico, leaving a mother and child behind ENDEND 
This is going to be an emotional issue ENDEND  It's not going to go away any time soon ENDEND  I think what we saw in those marches is the face of a new America ENDEND  America is changing and we can't be threatened by it ENDEND  We have to understand that we are going to be better off united than divided ENDEND 
When I spoke to folks at this rally I insisted that for those undocumented workers who hope some way to have a pathway to citizenship, they have to understand that citizenship involves a common language, a common faith in the country, common commitments and a common sense of purpose, fealty to a common flag ENDEND  I think there are times in these marches were you have seen Mexican flags; there has been controversy around a Spanish national anthem ENDEND  I think that is not helpful because it indicates that somehow the traditional pattern of immigrants assimilating to a broader American culture is not what these marchers are seeking ENDEND  I think they have to seek that because that is the essence of this country  that in diversity we come together as one ENDEND 
On the other hand, to those who are fearful of these immigrants, in some cases because they have come to represent a loss of control for the country and its borders, I would just say to them that we can't have a country in which you have a servant class that is picking our lettuce or plucking our chickens or looking after our children or mowing our lawns but who never have the full rights and obligations of citizenship ENDEND  That's just not the kind of country that I want to have my children grow up in and my hope is that over the coming months we can come up with the kind of comprehensive, thoughtful legislation that I think the Senate bill reflects and we can have strong border security, we can have employers do the right thing by hiring those who are here legally in some fashion, but that we also provide all those families, children, elderly people and teenagers that I saw in that amazing march on Monday the opportunity to be full members of the American community ENDEND 
Anyway, I will keep you guys posted on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you next week ENDEND  Byebye ENDEND Manassas, Prince William County, Virginia
November , 
:pm – Night Before the Election
What a scene ENDEND  What a crowd ENDEND  Thank you for Virginia ENDEND  
Let me start by noting, Virginia that this is our last rally ENDEND  This is the last rally of a campaign that began nearly  years ago ENDEND  We've gone to every corner of this country, from here in Northern Virginia to the rocky coasts of Maine, to the open plains of Texas, to the open skies of Montana ENDEND 
I just want to say that whatever happens tomorrow, I have been deeply humbled by this journey ENDEND  You have welcomed Michelle and me and the girls into your homes ENDEND  You have shared your stories of struggle, you have spoken of your dreams, along the way, talking with all of you about your own lives ENDEND 
You have enriched my life, you have moved me again and again ENDEND  You have inspired me ENDEND  Sometimes when I have been down you have lifted me up ENDEND  You filled me with new hope for our future and you have reminded me about what makes America so special ENDEND  In the places I have gone and the people I have met, I have been struck again and again by the fundamental decency and generosity and dignity of men and women who work hard without complaint, to meet their responsibilities every day ENDEND 
I come away with an unyielding belief that if we only had a government as responsible as all of you, as compassionate as the American people, that there is no obstacle that we can't overcome ENDEND  There is no destiny that we cannot fulfill ENDEND 
Virginia, I have just one word for you, just one word ENDEND  Tomorrow ENDEND  Tomorrow ENDEND  After decades of broken politics in Washington,  years of failed policies from George Bush, twentyone months of campaigning, we are less then one day away from bringing about change in America ENDEND 
Tomorrow you can turn the page on policies that put greed and irresponsibility before hard work and sacrifice ENDEND  Tomorrow you can choose policies that invest in our middle class, create new jobs and grow this economy so that everybody has a chance to succeed ENDEND  Not just the CEO but the secretary and the janitor; not just the factory owner but the men and women who work the factory floor ENDEND  Tomorrow you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election; that puts reason against reason, and city against town, Republican against Democrat; that asks us to fear at a time when we need to hope ENDEND 
Tomorrow, at this defining moment in history, you can give this country the change that we need ENDEND  It starts here in Virginia ENDEND  It starts here in Manassas ENDEND  This is where change begins ENDEND 
Our campaign has not been perfect ENDEND  There are times when I look back and I've said, "you know I wouldn't have done that if I had thought about it a little bit more ENDEND " But I'll tell you what ENDEND  When you think about this campaign we've got a lot to be proud of when it comes to the tone that we have set ENDEND 
We tried to argue issues and not engage in personal attacks ENDEND  We've been fierce in defending ourselves but we've tried to make sure that we are always reminding our supporters that all of us are in this together ENDEND  Black, white, Hispanic, native American, Asian, Democrats and Republicans, young and old, rich and poor, gay and straight, disabled and not disabled, all of us have something to contribute ENDEND 
We tried to communicate for these last two years that we can't afford the same political games, the same tactics that pit us against one another, that make us afraid of each other ENDEND  We can't afford that anymore ENDEND  Not this time ENDEND  Despite what our opponents might claim, there are no real or fake parts of Virginia anymore and then there are real or fake parts of America ENDEND  There is no city or town that is more proAmerica than anywhere else ENDEND  We are all one nation ENDEND  All of us proud ENDEND  All of us patriots ENDEND  All of us salute this flag ENDEND 
The men and women who serve on our battlefields come from many walks of life, different political parties, but they fought together and they bled together ENDEND  Some die together under the same proud flag ENDEND  They have not served red America or blue America, they have served the United States of America ENDEND  And that is what this campaign has been about, we're calling us to serve the United States of America ENDEND 
In this campaign I have had the privilege to witness what is best in America, in the stories, in the faces, of men and women I have met at countless rallies, town hall meetings, VFW halls, living rooms, diners, all across America, men and women who shared with me their stories and spoke of their struggles but they also spoke of their hopes and dreams ENDEND  They want for their children a sense of obligation and debts to be paid to earlier generations ENDEND 
I met one of those women in Greenwood, South Carolina ENDEND  It was back early when we were way back in the polls ENDEND  Nobody gave us much of a chance back then ENDEND  I had gone to South Carolina early in the campaign to see what I could stir up in the way of endorsements, and I was at a legislative dinner sitting next to a state representative that I really wanted to endorse me ENDEND  So I turned to her and I said "I really want your endorsement ENDEND " And she looked at me and she said "I'll tell you what, Obama, I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina ENDEND " I must have had a sip of wine or something that night because right away I said "Okay ENDEND  I'm coming ENDEND "
So the next time I come to South Carolina it's about a month later ENDEND  We fly in about midnight ENDEND  We get to the hotel about one o'clock in the morning ENDEND  I'm exhausted ENDEND  I'm dragging my bags to my room when I get a tap on my shoulder and I look back and it is one of my staff people who says "Senator we need to be out of the hotel by  a ENDEND m ENDEND " I say "Why is that?" He says "because we have to go to Greenwood, like you promised ENDEND "
So the next morning I wake up and I feel terrible, and I think I am coming down with a cold, my back is sore, I feel worse than when I went to bed ENDEND  I open up the curtains in the hotel room to get some sunlight in and hopefully wake me up, but it's pouring down rain ENDEND  I go outside my room and get the New York Times, and there is a bad story about me in the New York Times ENDEND  I go downstairs after I pack, and my umbrella blows open and I get soaked, so by the time I get in the car I am mad, I am wet and I am sleepy ENDEND 
We drive, and we drive, and we drive ENDEND  It turns out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everywhere else ENDEND  Finally we get to Greenwood ENDEND 
First of all you do not know you're in Greenwood when you get to Greenwood, there aren't a lot of tall buildings in Greenwood ENDEND  We pull off to a small building — a little field house in a park — and we go inside, and low and behold, after an hour and a half drive, turns out there are  people there ENDEND  Twenty people ENDEND  They look all kind of damp and sleepy, maybe they aren't really excited to be there either ENDEND 
But I am a professional, I've got to do what I got to do ENDEND  I'm going around, I'm shaking hands, I am saying "How are you doing? What are you doing?"
As I go around the room suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me "fired up ENDEND " I'm shocked ENDEND  I jumped up ENDEND  I don't know what is going on ENDEND  But everyone else acts as though this were normal and they say "fired up ENDEND " Then I hear this voice say "ready to go ENDEND " And the  people in the room act like this happens all the time and they say "ready to go" ENDEND 
I don't know what's going on so I looked behind me and there is this small woman, about  years old, a little over  feet, looks like she just came from church — she's got on a big church hat ENDEND  She's standing there, she looks at me and she smiles and she says "fired up ENDEND "
It turns out that she was a city Councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective ENDEND  I'm not making this up ENDEND  And it turns out that she is famous for her chant ENDEND  She does this where ever she goes ENDEND  She says "fired up" and the people say "fired up", and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go ENDEND "
For the next five minutes she proceeds to do this ENDEND  "Fired up?" and everyone says "fired up" and she says "ready to go" and they say "ready to go ENDEND " I'm standing there and I'm thinking I'm being outflanked by this woman ENDEND  She's stealing my thunder ENDEND  I look at my staff and they shrugged their shoulders, they don't know how long this is going to go on ENDEND 
But here's the thing, Virginia ENDEND  After a minute or so I am feeling kind of fired up ENDEND  I'm feeling like I'm ready to go ENDEND  So I join in the chant ENDEND  It feels good ENDEND  For the rest of the day, even after we left Greenwood, even though it was still raining, even though I was still not getting big crowds anywhere, even though we hadn't gotten the endorsement from the people we were hoping for, somehow I felt a little lighter, a little better ENDEND  I'd see my staff and I would say "Are you fired up? and they would say "We are fired up, boss, are you ready to go?" And I'd say "I'm ready to go ENDEND "
Here's my point, Virginia ENDEND  That's how this thing started ENDEND  It shows you what one voice can do ENDEND  That one voice can change a room ENDEND  And if a voice can change a room, it can change a city, and if it can change a city, it can change a state, and if it can change a state, it can change a nation, and if it can change a nation, it can change the world ENDEND 
Virginia, your voice can change the world tomorrow ENDEND  In  hours if you are willing to endure some rain, if you are willing to drag that person you know who is not going to vote, to the polls ENDEND  If you are willing to organize and volunteer in the offices, if you are willing to stand with me, if you are willing to fight with me, I know your voice will matter ENDEND 
So I have just one question for you Virginia, Are you fired up? Ready to go? Fired up ENDEND  Ready to go ENDEND  Fired up ENDEND  Ready to go ENDEND  Fired up ENDEND  Ready to go ENDEND 
Virginia, let's go change the world ENDEND  God bless you and God bless the United States of America ENDEND Grant Park, Illinois
If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible; who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time; who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer ENDEND 
It’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen; by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the very first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different; that their voice could be that difference ENDEND 
It’s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled – Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States: we are, and always will be, the United States of America ENDEND 
It’s the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical, and fearful, and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day ENDEND 
It’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment, change has come to America ENDEND 
I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain ENDEND  He fought long and hard in this campaign, and he’s fought even longer and harder for the country he loves ENDEND  He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine, and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader ENDEND  I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved, and I look forward to working with them to renew this nation’s promise in the months ahead ENDEND 
I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware, the Vice Presidentelect of the United States, Joe Biden ENDEND 
I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years, the rock of our family and the love of my life, our nation’s next First Lady, Michelle Obama ENDEND  Sasha and Malia, I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the White House ENDEND  And while she’s no longer with us, I know my grandmother is watching, along with the family that made me who I am ENDEND  I miss them tonight, and know that my debt to them is beyond measure ENDEND 
To my campaign manager David Plouffe, my chief strategist David Axelrod, and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics – you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you’ve sacrificed to get it done ENDEND 
But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to – it belongs to you ENDEND 
I was never the likeliest candidate for this office ENDEND  We didn’t start with much money or many endorsements ENDEND  Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington – it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston ENDEND 
It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause ENDEND  It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy; who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep; from the notsoyoung people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers; from the millions of Americans who volunteered, and organized, and proved that more than two centuries later, a government of the people, by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth ENDEND  This is your victory ENDEND  I know you didn’t do this just to win an election and I know you didn’t do it for me ENDEND  You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead ENDEND  For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime – two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century ENDEND  Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us ENDEND  There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how they’ll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor’s bills, or save enough for college ENDEND  There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created; new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair ENDEND 
The road ahead will be long ENDEND  Our climb will be steep ENDEND  We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America – I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there ENDEND  I promise you – we as a people will get there ENDEND 
There will be setbacks and false starts ENDEND  There are many who won’t agree with every decision or policy I make as President, and we know that government can’t solve every problem ENDEND  But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face ENDEND  I will listen to you, especially when we disagree ENDEND  And above all, I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way it’s been done in America for twohundred and twentyone years – block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand ENDEND 
What began twentyone months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night ENDEND  This victory alone is not the change we seek – it is only the chance for us to make that change ENDEND  And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were ENDEND  It cannot happen without you ENDEND 
So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism; of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other ENDEND  Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers – in this country, we rise or fall as one nation; as one people ENDEND 
Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long ENDEND  Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House – a party founded on the values of selfreliance, individual liberty, and national unity ENDEND  Those are values we all share, and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress ENDEND  As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, “We are not enemies, but friends…though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection ENDEND ” And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn – I may not have won your vote, but I hear your voices, I need your help, and I will be your President too ENDEND 
And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world – our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand ENDEND  To those who would tear this world down – we will defeat you ENDEND  To those who seek peace and security – we support you ENDEND  And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright – tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope ENDEND 
For that is the true genius of America – that America can change ENDEND  Our union can be perfected ENDEND  And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow ENDEND 
This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations ENDEND  But one that’s on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta ENDEND  She’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing – Ann Nixon Cooper is  years old ENDEND 
She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two reasons – because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin ENDEND 
And tonight, I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America – the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can ENDEND 
At a time when women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot ENDEND  Yes we can ENDEND 
When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs and a new sense of common purpose ENDEND  Yes we can ENDEND 
When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved ENDEND  Yes we can ENDEND 
She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome ENDEND ” Yes we can ENDEND 
A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination ENDEND  And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after  years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change ENDEND  Yes we can ENDEND 
America, we have come so far ENDEND  We have seen so much ENDEND  But there is so much more to do ENDEND  So tonight, let us ask ourselves – if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?
This is our chance to answer that call ENDEND  This is our moment ENDEND  This is our time – to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth – that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope, and where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people:
Yes We Can ENDEND  Thank you, God bless you, and may God Bless the United States of America ENDEND 

To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States ENDEND 
Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest  a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton ENDEND  To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you ENDEND  I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night ENDEND 
To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia  I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you ENDEND 
Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story  of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't welloff or wellknown, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to ENDEND 
It is that promise that has always set this country apart  that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well ENDEND 
That's why I stand here tonight ENDEND  Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women  students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors  found the courage to keep it alive ENDEND 
We meet at one of those defining moments  a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more ENDEND 
Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less ENDEND  More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet ENDEND  More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach ENDEND 
These challenges are not all of government's making ENDEND  But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W ENDEND  Bush ENDEND 
America, we are better than these last eight years ENDEND  We are a better country than this ENDEND 
This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work ENDEND 
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news ENDEND 
We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes ENDEND 
Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land  enough This moment  this election  is our chance to keep, in the st century, the American promise alive ENDEND  Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third ENDEND  And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight ENDEND  On November th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough ENDEND "
Now let there be no doubt ENDEND  The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect ENDEND  And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need ENDEND 
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time ENDEND  Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change ENDEND 
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives  on health care and education and the economy  Senator McCain has been anything but independent ENDEND  He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President ENDEND  He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong ENDEND  And when one of his chief advisors  the man who wrote his economic plan  was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners ENDEND "
A nation of whiners? Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made ENDEND  Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty ENDEND  These are not whiners ENDEND  They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint ENDEND  These are the Americans that I know ENDEND 
Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans ENDEND  I just think he doesn't know ENDEND  Why else would he define middleclass as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
It's not because John McCain doesn't care ENDEND  It's because John McCain doesn't get it ENDEND 
For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy  give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else ENDEND  In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is  you're on your own ENDEND  Out of work? Tough luck ENDEND  No health care? The market will fix it ENDEND  Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps  even if you don't have boots ENDEND  You're on your own ENDEND 
Well it's time for them to own their failure ENDEND  It's time for us to change America ENDEND 
You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country ENDEND 
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma ENDEND  We measure progress in the  million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President  when the average American family saw its income go up , instead of down , like it has under George Bush ENDEND 
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune , but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job  an economy that honors the dignity of work ENDEND 
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight ENDEND 
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill ENDEND 
In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships ENDEND 
When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed ENDEND 
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middlemanagement, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman ENDEND  She's the one who taught me about hard work ENDEND  She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life ENDEND  She poured everything she had into me ENDEND  And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well ENDEND 
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine ENDEND  These are my heroes ENDEND  Theirs are the stories that shaped me ENDEND  And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States ENDEND 
What is that promise?
It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect ENDEND 
It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road ENDEND 
Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves  protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology ENDEND 
Our government should work for us, not against us ENDEND  It should help us, not hurt us ENDEND  It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work ENDEND 
That's the promise of America  the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper ENDEND 
That's the promise we need to keep ENDEND  That's the change we need right now ENDEND  So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President ENDEND 
Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it ENDEND 
Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America ENDEND 
I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the highwage, hightech jobs of tomorrow ENDEND 
I will cut taxes  cut taxes  for  of all working families ENDEND  Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middleclass ENDEND 
And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East ENDEND 
Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twentysix of them ENDEND  In that time, he's said no to higher fuelefficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels ENDEND  And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office ENDEND 
Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stopgap measure, not a longterm solution ENDEND  Not even close ENDEND 
As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ENDEND  I'll help our auto companies retool, so that the fuelefficient cars of the future are built right here in America ENDEND  I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars ENDEND  And I'll invest  billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy  wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced ENDEND 
America, now is not the time for small plans ENDEND 
Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a worldclass education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy ENDEND  Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education ENDEND  And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance ENDEND  I'll invest in early childhood education ENDEND  I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support ENDEND  And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability ENDEND  And we will keep our promise to every young American  if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education ENDEND 
Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American ENDEND  If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums ENDEND  If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves ENDEND  And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most ENDEND 
Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent ENDEND 
Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations ENDEND 
And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons ENDEND 
Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime  by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow ENDEND  But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  because we cannot meet twentyfirst century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy ENDEND 
And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money ENDEND  It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F ENDEND  Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength ENDEND " Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient ENDEND  Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair ENDEND  But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need ENDEND 
Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility  that's the essence of America's promise ENDEND 
And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad ENDEND  If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next CommanderinChief, that's a debate I'm ready to have ENDEND 
For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after , I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face ENDEND  When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on , and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights ENDEND  John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell  but he won't even go to the cave where he lives ENDEND 
And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a  billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war ENDEND 
That's not the judgment we need ENDEND  That won't keep America safe ENDEND  We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past ENDEND 
You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq ENDEND  You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington ENDEND  You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances ENDEND  If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice  but it is not the change we need ENDEND 
We are the party of Roosevelt ENDEND  We are the party of Kennedy ENDEND  So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country ENDEND  Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe ENDEND  The BushMcCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans  Democrats and Republicans  have built, and we are here to restore that legacy ENDEND 
As CommanderinChief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home ENDEND 
I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan ENDEND  I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts ENDEND  But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression ENDEND  I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease ENDEND  And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future ENDEND 
These are the policies I will pursue ENDEND  And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain ENDEND 
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes ENDEND  Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism ENDEND 
The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook ENDEND  So let us agree that patriotism has no party ENDEND  I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain ENDEND  The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag ENDEND  They have not served a Red America or a Blue America  they have served the United States of America ENDEND 
So I've got news for you, John McCain ENDEND  We all put our country first ENDEND 
America, our work will not be easy ENDEND  The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the wornout ideas and politics of the past ENDEND  For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits ENDEND  What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose  our sense of higher purpose ENDEND  And that's what we have to restore ENDEND 
We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country ENDEND  The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gangviolence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AKs out of the hands of criminals ENDEND  I know there are differences on samesex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination ENDEND  Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers ENDEND  This too is part of America's promise  the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort ENDEND 
I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk ENDEND  They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values ENDEND  And that's to be expected ENDEND  Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters ENDEND  If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from ENDEND 
You make a big election about small things ENDEND 
And you know what  it's worked before ENDEND  Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government ENDEND  When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty ENDEND  If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know ENDEND 
I get it ENDEND  I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office ENDEND  I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington ENDEND 
But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring ENDEND  What the naysayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me ENDEND  It's been about you ENDEND 
For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past ENDEND  You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result ENDEND  You have shown what history teaches us  that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington ENDEND  Change comes to Washington ENDEND  Change happens because the American people demand it  because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time ENDEND 
America, this is one of those moments ENDEND 
I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming ENDEND  Because I've seen it ENDEND  Because I've lived it ENDEND  I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work ENDEND  I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands ENDEND 
And I've seen it in this campaign ENDEND  In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time ENDEND  In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did ENDEND  I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who reenlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise ENDEND 
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich ENDEND  We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong ENDEND  Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores ENDEND 
Instead, it is that American spirit  that American promise  that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend ENDEND 
That promise is our greatest inheritance ENDEND  It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours  a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot ENDEND 
And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream ENDEND 
The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things ENDEND  They could've heard words of anger and discord ENDEND  They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred ENDEND 
But what the people heard instead  people of every creed and color, from every walk of life  is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked ENDEND  That together, our dreams can be one ENDEND 
"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried ENDEND  "And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead ENDEND  We cannot turn back ENDEND "
America, we cannot turn back ENDEND  Not with so much work to be done ENDEND  Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for ENDEND  Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save ENDEND  Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend ENDEND  America, we cannot turn back ENDEND  We cannot walk alone ENDEND  At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future ENDEND  Let us keep that promise  that American promise  and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess ENDEND 
Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America ENDEND 
I want to start by congratulating Senator Clinton on her victory tonight, and I want to thank the hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians who stood with our campaign today ENDEND 
There were a lot of folks who didn't think we could make this a close race when it started ENDEND  But we worked hard, and we traveled across the state to big cities and small towns, to factory floors and VFW halls ENDEND  And now, six weeks later, we closed the gap ENDEND  We rallied people of every age and race and background to our cause ENDEND  And whether they were inspired for the first time or for the first time in a long time, we registered a record number of voters who will lead our party to victory in November ENDEND 
These Americans cast their ballot for the same reason you came here tonight; for the same reason that millions of Americans have gone doortodoor and given whatever small amount they can to this campaign; for the same reason that we began this journey just a few hundred miles from here on a cold February morning in Springfield  because we believe that the challenges we face are bigger than the smallness of our politics, and we know that this election is our chance to change it ENDEND 
After fourteen long months, it's easy to forget this from time to time  to lose sight of the fierce urgency of this moment ENDEND  It's easy to get caught up in the distractions and the silliness and the titfortat that consumes our politics; the bickering that none of us are immune to, and that trivializes the profound issues  two wars, an economy in recession, a planet in peril ENDEND 
But that kind of politics is not why we're here ENDEND  It's not why I'm here and it's not why you're here ENDEND 
We're here because of the more than one hundred workers in Logansport, Indiana who just found out that their company has decided to move its entire factory to Taiwan ENDEND 
We're here because of the young man I met in Youngsville, North Carolina who almost lost his home because he has three children with cystic fibrosis and couldn't pay their medical bills; who still doesn't have health insurance for himself or his wife and lives in fear that a single illness could cost them everything ENDEND 
We're here because there are families all across this country who are sitting around the kitchen table right now trying to figure out how to pay their insurance premiums, and their kids' tuition, and still make the mortgage so they're not the next ones in the neighborhood to put a For Sale sign in the front yard; who will lay awake tonight wondering if next week's paycheck will cover next month's bills ENDEND 
We're not here to talk about change for change's sake, but because our families, our communities, and our country desperately need it ENDEND  We're here because we can't afford to keep doing what we've been doing for another four years ENDEND  We can't afford to play the same Washington games with the same Washington players and expect a different result ENDEND  Not this time ENDEND  Not now ENDEND 
We already know what we're getting from the other party's nominee ENDEND  John McCain has offered this country a lifetime of service, and we respect that, but what he's not offering is any meaningful change from the policies of George W ENDEND  Bush ENDEND 
John McCain believes that George Bush's Iraq policy is a success, so he's offering four more years of a war with no exit strategy; a war that's sending our troops on their third tour, and fourth tour, and fifth tour of duty; a war that's costing us billions of dollars a month and hasn't made us any safer ENDEND 
John McCain said that George Bush's economic policies have led to "great progress" over the last seven years, and so he's promising four more years of tax cuts for CEOs and corporations who didn't need them and weren't asking for them; tax cuts that he once voted against because he said they "offended his conscience ENDEND "
Well they may have stopped offending John McCain's conscience somewhere along the road to the White House, but George Bush's economic policies still offend ours ENDEND  Because I don't think that the , Americans who've lost their jobs this year are seeing the great progress that John McCain has seen ENDEND  I don't think the millions of Americans losing their homes have seen that progress ENDEND  I don't think the families without health care and the workers without pensions have seen that progress ENDEND  And if we continue down the same reckless path, I don't think that future generations who'll be saddled with debt will see these as years of progress ENDEND 
We already know that John McCain offers more of the same ENDEND  The question is not whether the other party will bring about change in Washington  the question is, will we?
Because the truth is, the challenges we face are not just the fault of one man or one party ENDEND  How many years  how many decades  have we been talking about solving our health care crisis? How many Presidents have promised to end our dependence on foreign oil? How many jobs have gone overseas in the s, and the s, and the s? And we still haven't done anything about it ENDEND  And we know why ENDEND 
In every election, politicians come to your cities and your towns, and they tell you what you want to hear, and they make big promises, and they lay out all these plans and policies ENDEND  But then they go back to Washington when the campaign's over ENDEND  Lobbyists spend millions of dollars to get their way ENDEND  The status quo sets in ENDEND  And instead of fighting for health care or jobs, Washington ends up fighting over the latest distraction of the week ENDEND  It happens year after year after year ENDEND 
Well this is your chance to say "Not this year ENDEND " This is your chance to say "Not this time ENDEND " We have a choice in this election ENDEND 
We can be a party that says there's no problem with taking money from Washington lobbyists  from oil lobbyists and drug lobbyists and insurance lobbyists ENDEND  We can pretend that they represent real Americans and look the other way when they use their money and influence to stop us from reforming health care or investing in renewable energy for yet another four years ENDEND 
Or this time, we can recognize that you can't be the champion of working Americans if you're funded by the lobbyists who drown out their voices ENDEND  We can do what we've done in this campaign, and say that we won't take a dime of their money ENDEND  We can do what I did in Illinois, and in Washington, and bring both parties together to rein in their power so we can take our government back ENDEND  It's our choice ENDEND 
We can be a party that thinks the only way to look tough on national security is to talk, and act, and vote like George Bush and John McCain ENDEND  We can use fear as a tactic, and the threat of terrorism to scare up votes ENDEND 
Or we can decide that real strength is asking the tough questions before we send our troops to fight ENDEND  We can see the threats we face for what they are  a call to rally all Americans and all the world against the common challenges of the st century  terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease ENDEND  That's what it takes to keep us safe in the world ENDEND  That's the real legacy of Roosevelt and Kennedy and Truman ENDEND 
We can be a party that says and does whatever it takes to win the next election ENDEND  We can calculate and polltest our positions and tell everyone exactly what they want to hear ENDEND 
Or we can be the party that doesn't just focus on how to win but why we should ENDEND  We can tell everyone what they need to hear about the challenges we face ENDEND  We can seek to regain not just an office, but the trust of the American people that their leaders in Washington will tell them the truth ENDEND  That's the choice in this election ENDEND 
We can be a party of those who only think like we do and only agree with all our positions ENDEND  We can continue to slice and dice this country into Red States and Blue States ENDEND  We can exploit the divisions that exist in our country for pure political gain ENDEND 
Or this time, we can build on the movement we've started in this campaign  a movement that's united Democrats, Independents, and Republicans; a movement of young and old, rich and poor; white, black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American ENDEND  Because one thing I know from traveling to fortysix states this campaign season is that we're not as divided as our politics suggests ENDEND  We may have different stories and different backgrounds, but we hold common hopes for the future of this country ENDEND 
In the end, this election is still our best chance to solve the problems we've been talking about for decades  as one nation; as one people ENDEND  Fourteen months later, that is still what this election is about ENDEND 
Millions of Americans who believe we can do better  that we must do better  have put us in a position to bring about real change ENDEND  Now it's up to you, Indiana ENDEND  You can decide whether we're going to travel the same worn path, or whether we chart a new course that offers real hope for the future ENDEND 
During the course of this campaign, we've all learned what my wife reminds me of all the time  that I am not a perfect man ENDEND  And I will not be a perfect President ENDEND  And so while I will always listen to you, and be honest with you, and fight for you every single day for the next for years, I will also ask you to be a part of the change that we need ENDEND  Because in my two decades of public service to this country, I have seen time and time again that real change doesn't begin in the halls of Washington, but on the streets of America ENDEND  It doesn't happen from the topdown, it happens from the bottomup ENDEND 
I also know that real change has never been easy, and it won't be easy this time either ENDEND  The status quo in Washington will fight harder than they ever have to divide us and distract us with ads and attacks from now until November ENDEND 
But don't ever forget that you have the power to change this country ENDEND 
You can make this election about how we're going to help those workers in Logansport; how we're going to retrain them, and educate them, and make our workforce competitive in a global economy ENDEND 
You can make this election about how we're going to make health care affordable for that family in North Carolina; how we're going to help those families sitting around the kitchen table tonight pay their bills and stay in their homes ENDEND 
You can make this election about how we plan to leave our children and all children a planet that's safer and a world that still sees America the same way my father saw it from across the ocean  as a beacon of all that is good and all that is possible for all mankind ENDEND 
It is now our turn to follow in the footsteps of all those generations who sacrificed and struggled and faced down the greatest odds to perfect our improbable union ENDEND  And if we're willing to do what they did; if we're willing to shed our cynicism and our doubts and our fears; if we're willing to believe in what's possible again; then I believe that we won't just win this primary election, we won't just win this election in November, we will change this country, and keep this country's promise alive in the twentyfirst century ENDEND  Thank you, and may God Bless the United States of America ENDEND 

Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today ENDEND 
We all made this journey for a reason ENDEND  It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be ENDEND  In the face of war, you believe there can be peace ENDEND  In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope ENDEND  In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union ENDEND 
That's the journey we're on today ENDEND  But let me tell you how I came to be here ENDEND  As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state ENDEND  I moved to Illinois over two decades ago ENDEND  I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections ENDEND  But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for , a year ENDEND  And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea  that I might play a small part in building a better America ENDEND 
My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods ENDEND  I joined with pastors and laypeople to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings ENDEND  I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature  that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill ENDEND 
It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith ENDEND 
After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need ENDEND  I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate ENDEND  It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator ENDEND 
It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge  farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard ENDEND  I made lasting friendships here  friends that I see in the audience today ENDEND 
It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable  that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst ENDEND 
That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken ENDEND  That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need ENDEND  That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed ENDEND 
It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people  where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America ENDEND 
And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States ENDEND 
I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness  a certain audacity  to this announcement ENDEND  I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington ENDEND  But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change ENDEND 
The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed ENDEND  And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before ENDEND  In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees ENDEND  In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free ENDEND  In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty ENDEND  We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream ENDEND 
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done ENDEND  Today we are called once more  and it is time for our generation to answer that call ENDEND 
For that is our unyielding faith  that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it ENDEND 
That's what Abraham Lincoln understood ENDEND  He had his doubts ENDEND  He had his defeats ENDEND  He had his setbacks ENDEND  But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people ENDEND  It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free ENDEND  It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people  as Americans ENDEND 
All of us know what those challenges are today  a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can ENDEND  We know the challenges ENDEND  We've heard them ENDEND  We've talked about them for years ENDEND 
What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans ENDEND  What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics  the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems ENDEND 
For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an illconceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight ENDEND  And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault ENDEND  We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants ENDEND 
And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void ENDEND  The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play ENDEND  They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back ENDEND  The time for that politics is over ENDEND  It's time to turn the page ENDEND 
We've made some progress already ENDEND  I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate ENDEND 
But Washington has a long way to go ENDEND  And it won't be easy ENDEND  That's why we'll have to set priorities ENDEND  We'll have to make hard choices ENDEND  And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go ENDEND  Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility  for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice ENDEND  So let us begin ENDEND  Let us begin this hard work together ENDEND  Let us transform this nation ENDEND 
Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age ENDEND  Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed ENDEND  Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability ENDEND  Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America ENDEND 
And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity ENDEND  Let's protect the hardearned benefits their companies have promised ENDEND  Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement ENDEND  And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middleclass again ENDEND 
Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America ENDEND  Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work ENDEND  Let's do this ENDEND 
Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis ENDEND  We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy ENDEND  Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term ENDEND 
Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil ENDEND  We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuelefficient cars ENDEND  We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases ENDEND  We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world ENDEND  Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here ENDEND 
Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got ENDEND  Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore  we can work together to keep our country safe ENDEND  I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons ENDEND  We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities ENDEND  But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe ENDEND 
But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq ENDEND  Most of you know I opposed this war from the start ENDEND  I thought it was a tragic mistake ENDEND  Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been ENDEND  America, it's time to start bringing our troops home ENDEND  It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war ENDEND  That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of  ENDEND  Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace ENDEND 
Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war  and that is the homecoming of the men and women  our veterans  who have sacrificed the most ENDEND  Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love ENDEND  Let us be the generation that begins this work ENDEND 
I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things ENDEND  I understand the skepticism ENDEND  After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different ENDEND  All of us running for president will travel around the country offering tenpoint plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country ENDEND  But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own ENDEND 
That is why this campaign can't only be about me ENDEND  It must be about us  it must be about what we can do together ENDEND  This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams ENDEND  It will take your time, your energy, and your advice  to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not ENDEND  This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change ENDEND 
By ourselves, this change will not happen ENDEND  Divided, we are bound to fail ENDEND 
But the life of a tall, gangly, selfmade Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible ENDEND 
He tells us that there is power in words ENDEND 
He tells us that there is power in conviction ENDEND 
That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people ENDEND 
He tells us that there is power in hope ENDEND 
As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through ENDEND "
That is our purpose here today ENDEND 
That's why I'm in this race ENDEND 
Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation ENDEND 
I want to win that next battle  for justice and opportunity ENDEND 
I want to win that next battle  for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all ENDEND 
I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America ENDEND 
And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you ENDEND  Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth ENDEND 

I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here ENDEND  I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the campaigning will begin in earnest ENDEND  And there will be second attack ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans ENDEND  And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire ENDEND 
And yet, while I know all of this, I'm still disappointed ENDEND  Because what we're doing here today  a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused  should be bigger than politics ENDEND  This is serious ENDEND 
If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences  heartfelt convictions that couldn't be settled by compromise  I would understand ENDEND  But it's not ENDEND 
All of us  Democrats and Republicans  want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible ENDEND  All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this ENDEND  And all of us were willing to do that in this bill ENDEND  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people ENDEND 
In the five years that the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one terrorist has been tried ENDEND  Not one has been convicted ENDEND  And in the end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, which is why we're here today ENDEND 
We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay ENDEND  Easily ENDEND  This was not an eitheror question ENDEND 
Instead of allowing this President  or any President  to decide what does and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered ENDEND 
Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused ENDEND 
And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus  the seven centuryold right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one chance  one single chance  to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with ENDEND 
But politics won today ENDEND  Politics won ENDEND  The Administration got its vote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists ENDEND 
And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of  his day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists  people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives ENDEND 
And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I quote, " ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND "
And yet, we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way ENDEND  We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool ENDEND  And we have recommendations from the bipartisan  commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact ENDEND 
The problem with this bill is not that it's too tough on terrorists ENDEND  The problem with this bill is that it's sloppy ENDEND  And the reason it's sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right ENDEND 
I've heard, for example, the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal judges, who should make decisions on these detainees ENDEND  I actually agree with that ENDEND  The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through ENDEND  Indeed, the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued ENDEND  Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court ENDEND 
This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism ENDEND  I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern ENDEND  He's absolutely right it should be our primary concern  which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation ENDEND 
Now, let me be clear  for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not ENDEND  And for those who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot ENDEND 
But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever ENDEND  We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldn't have been there  as one United States   commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks ENDEND " And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information ENDEND 
In the future, people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence ENDEND  They may remain locked away forever ENDEND 
And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary ENDEND  We could've drafted a bipartisan, wellstructured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great ENDEND 
Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of ENDEND  And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November th ENDEND 
That is not how we should be doing business in the United States   Senate, and that's not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism ENDEND  When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war ENDEND  At bare minimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 
It has now been a little over two months since we began this campaign ENDEND  In that time we have traveled all across this country ENDEND  And before every event we do, I usually have a minute to sit quietly and collect my thoughts ENDEND  And recently, I’ve found myself reflecting on what it was that led me to public service in the first place ENDEND 
I live in Chicago now, but I am not a native of that great city ENDEND  I moved there when I was just a year out of college, and a group of churches offered me a job as a community organizer so I could help rebuild neighborhoods that had been devastated by the closing of steel plants ENDEND 
The salary was , a year plus enough money to buy an old, beatup car, and so I took the job and drove out to Chicago, where I didn’t know a soul ENDEND  And during the time I was there, we worked to set up job training programs for the unemployed and after school programs for kids ENDEND 
And it was the best education I ever had, because I learned in those neighborhoods that when ordinary people come together, they can achieve extraordinary things ENDEND 
After three years, I went back to law school ENDEND  I left there with a degree and a lifetime of debt, but I turned down the corporate job offers so I could come back to Chicago and organize a voter registration drive ENDEND  I also started a civil rights practice, and began to teach constitutional law ENDEND 
And after a few years, people started coming up to me and telling me I should run for state Senate ENDEND  So I did what every man does when he’s faced with a big decision – I prayed, and I asked my wife ENDEND  And after consulting those two higher powers, I decided to get in the race ENDEND 
And everywhere I’d go, I’d get two questions ENDEND  First, they’d ask, “Where’d you get that funny name, Barack Obama?” Because people just couldn’t pronounce it ENDEND  They’d call me “Alabama,” or they’d call me “Yo Mama ENDEND ” And I’d tell them that my father was from Kenya, and that’s where I got my name ENDEND  And my mother was from Kansas, and that’s where I got my accent from ENDEND 
And the second thing people would ask me was, “You seem like a nice young man ENDEND  You’ve done all this great work ENDEND  You’ve been a community organizer, and you teach law school, you’re a civil rights attorney, you’re a family man – why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?”
And I understand the question, and the cynicism ENDEND  We all understand it ENDEND 
We understand it because we get the sense today that politics has become a business and not a mission ENDEND  In the last several years, we have seen Washington become a place where keeping score of who’s up and who’s down is more important than who’s working on behalf of the American people ENDEND 
We have been told that our mounting debts don’t matter, that the economy is doing great, and so Americans should be left to face their anxiety about rising health care costs and disappearing pensions on their own ENDEND 
We’ve been told that climate change is a hoax, that our broken schools cannot be fixed, that we are destined to send millions of dollars a day to Mideast dictators for their oil ENDEND  And we’ve seen how a foreign policy based on bluster and bombast can lead us into a war that should’ve never been authorized and never been waged ENDEND 
And when we try to have an honest debate about the crises we face, whether it’s on the Senate floor or a Sunday talk show, the conversation isn’t about finding common ground, it’s about finding someone to blame ENDEND  We’re divided into Red States and Blue States, and told to always point the finger at somebody else – the other party, or gay people, or immigrants ENDEND 
For good reason, the rest of us have become cynical about what politics can achieve in this country, and as we’ve turned away in frustration, we know what’s filled the void ENDEND  The lobbyists and influencepeddlers with the cash and the connections – the ones who’ve turned government into a game only they can afford to play ENDEND 
They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we’re here to tell them it’s not for sale ENDEND  People tell me I haven’t spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington ENDEND  But I promise you this – I’ve been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change ENDEND  I’m running for President because the time for the can’tdo, won’tdo, won’teventry style of politics is over ENDEND  It’s time to turn the page ENDEND  There is an awakening taking place in America today ENDEND  From New Hampshire to California, from Texas to Iowa, we are seeing crowds we’ve never seen before; we’re seeing people showing up to the very first political event of their lives ENDEND 
They’re coming because they know we are at a crossroads right now ENDEND  Because we are facing a set of challenges we haven’t seen in a generation – and if we don’t meet those challenges, we could end up leaving our children a world that’s a little poorer and a little meaner than we found it ENDEND 
And so the American people are hungry for a different kind of politics – the kind of politics based on the ideals this country was founded upon ENDEND  The idea that we are all connected as one people ENDEND  That we all have a stake in one another ENDEND 
It’s what I learned as a state Senator in Illinois ENDEND  That you can turn the page on old debates; that it’s possible to compromise so long as you as you never compromise your principles; and that so long as we’re willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst ENDEND 
That’s how we were able to reform a death penalty system that sent  innocent people to death row ENDEND  That’s how we were able to give health insurance to , more children who needed it ENDEND  That’s how we gave  million worth of tax cuts to working families in Illinois ENDEND  And that’s how we passed the first ethics reform in twentyfive years ENDEND 
We have seen too many campaigns where our problems are talked to death ENDEND  Where tenpoint plans are crushed under the weight of the same old politics once the election’s over ENDEND  Where experience in Washington doesn’t always translate to results for the American people ENDEND 
And so if we do not change our politics – if we do not fundamentally change the way Washington works – then the problems we’ve been talking about for the last generation will be the same ones that haunt us for generations to come ENDEND 
We must find a way to come together in this country – to realize that the responsibility we have to one another as Americans is greater than the pursuit of any ideological agenda or corporate bottom line ENDEND  Democrats of California, it’s time to turn the page ENDEND 
It’s time to turn the page on health care – to bring together unions and businesses, Democrats and Republicans, and to let the insurance and drug companies know that while they get a seat at the table, they don’t get to buy every chair ENDEND 
When I am president, I will sign a universal health care law by the end of my first term ENDEND  My plan will cover the uninsured by letting people buy into the same kind of health care plan that members of Congress give themselves ENDEND  It will bring down costs by investing in information technology, and preventative care, and by stopping the drug companies from pricegouging when patients need their medicine ENDEND 
It will help business and families shoulder the burden of catastrophic care so that an illness doesn’t lead to a bankruptcy ENDEND  And it will save the average family a thousand dollars a year on their premiums ENDEND  We can do this ENDEND 
It’s time to turn the page on education – to move past the slow decay of indifference that says some schools can’t be fixed and some kids just can’t learn ENDEND 
As President, I will launch a campaign to recruit and support hundreds of thousands of new teachers across the country, because the most important part of any education is the person standing in the front of the classroom ENDEND  It’s time to treat teaching like the profession it is – paying teachers what they deserve and working with them – not against them – to develop the high standards we need ENDEND  We can do this ENDEND 
It’s time to turn the page on energy – to break the political stalemate that’s kept our fuel efficiency standards in the same place for twenty years; to tell the oil and auto industries that they must act, not only because their future’s at stake, but because the future of our country and our planet is at stake as well ENDEND 
As President, I will institute a capandtrade system that would dramatically reduce carbon emissions and auction off emissions credits that would generate millions of dollars to invest in renewable sources of energy ENDEND  I’ll put in place a lowcarbon fuel standard like you have here in California that will take  million cars’ worth of pollution off the road ENDEND  And I’d raise the fuel efficiency standards for our cars and trucks because we know we have the technology to do it and it’s time we did ENDEND  We can do this ENDEND 
We can do all of this ENDEND  But most of all, we have to turn the page on this disaster in Iraq and restore our standing in the world ENDEND  I am proud that I stood up in  and urged our leaders not to take us down this dangerous path ENDEND  And so many of you did the same, even when it wasn’t popular to do so ENDEND 
We knew back then this war was a mistake ENDEND  We knew back then that it was dangerous diversion from the struggle against the terrorists who attacked us on September th ENDEND  We knew back then that we could find ourselves in an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences ENDEND 
But the war went forward ENDEND  And now, we’ve seen those consequences and we mourn for the dead and wounded ENDEND 
I was in New Hampshire the other week when a woman told me that her nephew was leaving for Iraq ENDEND  And as she started telling me how much she’d miss him and how worried she was about him, she began to cry ENDEND 
And she said to me, “I can’t breathe ENDEND  I want to know, when am I going to be able to breathe again?”
It is time to let this woman know she can breathe again ENDEND  It is time to put an end this war ENDEND 
The majority of both houses of the American Congress – Republicans and Democrats – just passed a bill that would do exactly that ENDEND  It’s a bill similar to the plan I introduced in January that says there is no military solution to this civil war – that the last, best hope to pressure the warring factions to reach a political settlement is to let the Iraqi government know that America will not be there forever – to begin a phased withdrawal with the goal of bringing all combat brigades home by March st,  ENDEND 
We are one signature away from ending this war ENDEND  If the President refuses to sign it, we will go back and find the sixteen votes we need to end this war without him ENDEND  We will turn up the pressure on all those Republican Congressmen and Senators who refuse to acknowledge the reality that the American people know so well, and we will get this done ENDEND  We will bring our troops home ENDEND  It’s time to turn the page ENDEND 
It’s time to show the world that America is still the last, best hope of Earth ENDEND  This President may occupy the White House, but for the last six years the position of leader of the free world has remained open ENDEND  It’s time to fill that role once more ENDEND  Whether it’s terrorism or climate change, global AIDS or the spread of weapons of mass destruction, America cannot meet the threats of this new century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America ENDEND  It’s time for us to lead ENDEND 
It’s time for us to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries ENDEND  That we are not a country that runs prisons which lock people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with ENDEND  We are not a country which preaches compassion to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city ENDEND 
That is not who we are ENDEND 
We are America ENDEND  We are the nation that liberated a continent from a madman, that lifted ourselves from the depths of Depression, that won Civil Rights, and Women’s Rights, and Voting Rights for all our people ENDEND  We are the beacon that has led generations of weary travelers to find opportunity, and liberty, and hope on our doorstep ENDEND  That’s who we are ENDEND 
I was down in Selma, Alabama awhile back, and we were celebrating the nd anniversary of the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge ENDEND  It was a march of ordinary Americans – maids and cooks, preachers and Pullman porters who faced down fire hoses and dogs, tear gas and billy clubs when they tried to get to the other side ENDEND  But every time they were stopped, every time they were knocked down, they got back up, they came back, and they kept on marching ENDEND  And finally they crossed over ENDEND  It was called Bloody Sunday, and it was the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement ENDEND 
When I came back from that celebration, people would say, oh, what a wonderful celebration of AfricanAmerican history that must have been ENDEND  And I would say, no, that wasn’t AfricanAmerican history ENDEND  That was a celebration of American history – it’s our story ENDEND 
And it reminds us of a simple truth – a truth I learned all those years ago as an organizer in Chicago – a truth you carry by being here today – that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it ENDEND 
I am confident about my ability to lead this country ENDEND  But I also know that I can’t do it without you ENDEND  There will be times when I get tired, there will be times when I make a mistake – it’s true, talk to my wife, she’ll tell you ENDEND  But this campaign that we’re running has to be about your hopes, and your dreams, and what you will do ENDEND  Because there are few obstacles that can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change ENDEND 
That’s how change has always happened – not from the topdown, but from the bottomup ENDEND 
And that’s exactly how you and I will change this country ENDEND  California, if you want a new kind of politics, it’s time to turn the page ENDEND 
If you want an end to the old divisions, and the stale debates, and the scorekeeping and the namecalling, it’s time to turn the page ENDEND 
If you want health care for every American and a worldclass education for all our children; if you want energy independence and an end to this war in Iraq; if you believe America is still that last, best hope of Earth, then it’s time to turn the page ENDEND 
It’s time to turn the page for hope ENDEND  It’s time to turn the page for justice ENDEND  It is time to turn the page and write the next chapter in the great American story ENDEND  Let’s begin the work ENDEND  Let’s do this together ENDEND  Let’s turn that page ENDEND

There are countless reasons the American people have lost confidence in the President's Iraq policy, but chief among them has been the administration's insistence on making promises and assurances about progress and victory that do not appear to be grounded in the reality of the facts ENDEND  We have been told we would be greeted as liberators ENDEND  We have been promised the insurgency was in its last throes ENDEND  We have been assured again and again that we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so we could stand down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming home ENDEND  We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, and we have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government  more months, and then  more months after that, and then  more months after that ENDEND 
Now, after the loss of more than , American lives, after spending almost  billion, after Iraq has descended into civil war, we have been promised, once again, that the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq will, this time, be well planned, well coordinated, and well supported by the Iraqi Government ENDEND  This time, we didn't have to wait to find out that none of this seems to be the case ENDEND  Already, American military officials have told the New York Times that there is no clear chain of command between Iraqis and United States   commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership ENDEND  Yesterday, Prime Minister alMaliki, the person whom the President said had brought this plan to us, the man who is supposed to be our partnerinchief for this new plan, told foreign journalists that if the United States would only give his Army better weapons and equipment, our soldiers could go home ENDEND 
The President's decision to move forward with this escalation anyway, despite all evidence and military advice to the contrary, is the terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad, openended authority to wage this war back in  ENDEND  Over  years later, we can't revisit that decision or reverse some of the tragic outcomes, but what we can do is make sure we provide the kind of oversight and constraints on the President this time that we failed to do the last time ENDEND 
I cannot in good conscience support this escalation ENDEND  It is a policy which has already been tried and a policy which has failed ENDEND  Just this morning, I had veterans of the Iraq war visit my office to explain to me that this surge concept is, in fact, no different from what we have repeatedly tried, but with , troops, we will not in any imaginable way be able to accomplish any new progress ENDEND 
The fact is that we have tried this road before ENDEND  In the end, no amount of American forces can solve the political differences that lie at the heart of somebody else's civil war ENDEND  As the President's own military commanders have said, escalation only prevents the Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own future ENDEND  It is even eroding our efforts in the wider war on terror as some of the extra soldiers will come directly from Afghanistan, where the Taliban has become resurgent ENDEND 
The President has offered no evidence that more United States   troops will be able to pressure Shias, Sunnis, and Kurds toward the necessary political settlement, and he has attached no consequences to his plan should the Iraqis fail to make progress ENDEND  In fact, just last week, when I repeatedly asked Secretary Rice what would happen if the Iraqi Government failed to meet the benchmarks the President has called for and says are an integral part of their rationale for escalation, she couldn't give me an answer ENDEND  When I asked her if there were any circumstances whatsoever in which we would tell the Iraqis that their failure to make progress means the end of our military commitment, she could not give me an answer ENDEND  This is simply not good enough ENDEND  When you ask how many more months and how many more dollars and how many more lives it will take to end the policy that everyone now knows has not succeeded, I don't know'' isn't good enough ENDEND 
Over the past  years, we have given this administration every chance to get this right, and they have disappointed us many times ENDEND  But ultimately it is our brave men and women in uniform and their families who bear the greatest burden for these mistakes ENDEND  They have performed in an exemplary fashion ENDEND  At no stage have they faltered in the mission that has been presented to them ENDEND 
Unfortunately, the strategy, the tactics, and the mission itself have been flawed ENDEND  That is why Congress now has the duty to prevent even more mistakes and bring this war to a responsible end ENDEND  That is why I plan to introduce legislation which I believe will stop the escalation of this war by placing a cap on the number of soldiers in Iraq ENDEND  I wish to emphasize that I am not unique in taking this approach ENDEND  I know Senator Dodd has crafted similar legislation ENDEND  Senator Clinton, I believe, yesterday indicated she shared similar views ENDEND  The cap would not affect the money spent on the war or on our troops, but it would write into law that the number of United States   forces in Iraq should not exceed the number that were there on January , , the day the President announced his escalation policy ENDEND 
This measure would stop the escalation of the war in Iraq, but it is my belief that simply opposing the surge is not good enough ENDEND  If we truly believe the only solution in Iraq is a political oneand I fervently believe thatif we believe a phased redeployment of United States   forces in Iraq is the bestperhaps onlyleverage we have to force a settlement between the country's warring factions, then we should act on that ENDEND  That is why the second part of my legislation is a plan for phased redeployment that I called for in a speech in Chicago  months ago ENDEND  It is a responsible plan that protects American troops without causing Iraq to suddenly descend into chaos ENDEND  The President must announce to the Iraqi people that within  to  months, under this plan, United States   policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in United States   forces ENDEND  The President should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates ENDEND 
Drawing down our troops in Iraq will put pressure on Iraqis to arrive at the political settlement that is needed and allow us to redeploy additional troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region, as well as bring some back home ENDEND  The forces redeployed elsewhere in the region could then help to prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, something that every international observer is beginning to worry about ENDEND  It will also reassure our allies in the Gulf ENDEND  It will allow our troops to strike directly at alQaida wherever it may exist and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region ENDEND 
My plan would couple this phased redeployment with an enhanced effort to train Iraqi security forces and would expand the number of our personnelespecially special forceswho are deployed with Iraqis as unit advisers and would finally link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward reducing sectarian violence and reaching a political settlement ENDEND 
One final aspect of this plan that I believe is critical is it would call for engagement by the United States in a regional conference with other countries that are involved in the Middle Eastparticularly our allies, but including Syria and Iranto find a solution to the war in Iraq ENDEND  We have to realize that neither Iran nor Syria wants to see the security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region and within their own countries ENDEND  So as odious as the behavior of those regimes may be at times, it is important that we include them in a broader conversation about how we can stabilize Iraq ENDEND 
In closing, let me say this: I have been a consistent and strong opponent of this war ENDEND  I have also tried to act responsibly in that opposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we provide our troops, who perform valiantly, the support they need to complete their mission ENDEND  I have also stated publicly that I think we have both strategic interests and humanitarian responsibilities in ensuring that Iraq is as stable as possible under the circumstances ENDEND 
Finally, I said publicly that it is my preference not to micromanage the CommanderinChief in the prosecution of war ENDEND  Ultimately, I do not believe that is the ideal role for Congress to play ENDEND  But at a certain point, we have to draw a line ENDEND  At a certain point, the American people have to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this blind alley in perpetuity ENDEND 
When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience is over ENDEND  Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the President on another triedandfailed policy, opposed by generals and experts, opposed by Democrats and Republicans, opposed by Americans and even the Iraqis themselves ENDEND  It is time to change our policy ENDEND  It is time to give Iraqis their country back, and it is time to refocus America's effort on the wider struggle against terror yet to be won ENDEND 

Good morning ENDEND  I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference ENDEND  I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America ENDEND  It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country ENDEND  So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington ENDEND 
But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years ENDEND 
I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America ENDEND  We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle headon the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America ENDEND 
I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact ENDEND  As some of you know, during the  United States   Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes ENDEND  Mr. Keyes is wellversed in the Jerry FalwellPat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless ENDEND 
Indeed, Mr. Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama ENDEND  Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved ENDEND "
Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama ENDEND 
Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it ENDEND  To them, Mr. Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining ENDEND  And since at the time, I was up  points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice ENDEND 
But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr. Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God ENDEND  He claimed knowledge of certain truths ENDEND 
Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination ENDEND 
Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life ENDEND 
And so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr. Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?
Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates  namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the United States   Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois ENDEND 
But Mr. Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs ENDEND 
Now, my dilemma was by no means unique ENDEND  In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics ENDEND 
For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines ENDEND  Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in socalled Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't ENDEND 
Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design ENDEND 
Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait ENDEND  At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that  regardless of our personal beliefs  constitutional principles tie our hands ENDEND  At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith ENDEND 
Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes ENDEND  But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives  in the lives of the American people  and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy ENDEND 
And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people ENDEND   percent of us believe in God,  percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion,  percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution ENDEND 
This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular megachurches ENDEND  In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that  a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause ENDEND 
Each day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds  dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets  and they're coming to the realization that something is missing ENDEND  They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough ENDEND 
They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives ENDEND  They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before ENDEND  And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them  that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness ENDEND 
And I speak with some experience on this matter ENDEND  I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were ENDEND  My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist ENDEND  My mother, whose parents were nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself ENDEND  As a consequence, so did I ENDEND 
It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma ENDEND 
I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me ENDEND  They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs ENDEND  But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst ENDEND 
And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well  that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone ENDEND 
And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate ENDEND  But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn  not just to work with the church, but to be in the church ENDEND 
For one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the AfricanAmerican religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today ENDEND  Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities ENDEND  And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world ENDEND  As a source of hope ENDEND 
And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship  the grounding of faith in struggle  that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today ENDEND 
Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts ENDEND 
You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it ENDEND  You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away  because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey ENDEND 
It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith ENDEND  It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany ENDEND  I didn't fall out in church ENDEND  The questions I had didn't magically disappear ENDEND  But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me ENDEND  I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth ENDEND 
That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans  evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives ENDEND  It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values ENDEND  In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values ENDEND 
And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at  to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own  then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse ENDEND 
Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome  others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends ENDEND 
In other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway ENDEND 
More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms ENDEND  Some of the problem here is rhetorical  if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice ENDEND 
Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments of the Lord ENDEND " Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children ENDEND " Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny ENDEND 
Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though ENDEND  Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems ENDEND 
After all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan ENDEND  They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness  in the imperfections of man ENDEND 
Solving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds ENDEND  I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby  but I also believe that when a gangbanger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem ENDEND  There's a hole in that young man's heart  a hole that the government alone cannot fix ENDEND 
I believe in vigorous enforcement of our nondiscrimination laws ENDEND  But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers ENDEND  They have more lawyers than us anyway ENDEND 
I think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys ENDEND  I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth ENDEND  I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished ENDEND 
But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it ENDEND  So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy ENDEND 
I am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology  that can be dangerous ENDEND  Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith ENDEND  As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap  off rhythm  to the choir ENDEND  We don't need that ENDEND 
In fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not ENDEND  They don't need to do that ENDEND  None of us need to do that ENDEND 
But what I am suggesting is this  secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square ENDEND  Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King  indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history  were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause ENDEND  So to say that men and women should not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity ENDEND  Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the JudeoChristian tradition ENDEND 
Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country ENDEND  We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country ENDEND  And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal ENDEND 
Some of this is already beginning to happen ENDEND  Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and T ENDEND D ENDEND  Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur ENDEND  Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality ENDEND 
And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax ENDEND  When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate ENDEND 
Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping exoffenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina ENDEND 
So the question is, how do we build on these stilltentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far ENDEND  The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed ENDEND  And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration ENDEND 
While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do  some truths they need to acknowledge ENDEND 
For one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice ENDEND  Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment ENDEND  It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves ENDEND  It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want statesponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it ENDEND 
Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater ENDEND  Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers ENDEND 
And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every nonChristian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount  a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles ENDEND  Folks haven't been reading their bibles ENDEND 
This brings me to my second point ENDEND  Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religionspecific, values ENDEND  It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason ENDEND  I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will ENDEND  I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all ENDEND 
Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do ENDEND  But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice ENDEND  Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality ENDEND  It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible ENDEND  At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise ENDEND  It's the art of the impossible ENDEND  If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences ENDEND  To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing ENDEND  And if you doubt that, let me give you an example ENDEND 
We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac ENDEND  Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded ENDEND 
Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion ENDEND 
But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham ENDEND  We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be ENDEND  So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason ENDEND 
Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion ENDEND 
This goes for both sides ENDEND 
Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages  the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity  are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life ENDEND 
The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it ENDEND  Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics ENDEND 
But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state ENDEND  Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation  context matters ENDEND  It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God ENDEND " I didn't ENDEND  Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats ENDEND  And one can envision certain faithbased programs  targeting exoffenders or substance abusers  that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems ENDEND 
So we all have some work to do here ENDEND  But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate ENDEND  And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen ENDEND  No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack ENDEND  They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide ENDEND  They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon ENDEND  Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives ENDEND 
So let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign ENDEND  A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my United States   Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:
"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win ENDEND  I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election ENDEND  I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you ENDEND "
The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing ENDEND " His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda ENDEND 
But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion ENDEND  Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight "rightwing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose ENDEND " The doctor went on to write:
"I sense that you have a strong sense of justice ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND and I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND Whatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fairminded ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND You know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve others ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fairminded words ENDEND "
Fairminded words ENDEND 
So I looked at my website and found the offending words ENDEND  In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my prochoice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v ENDEND  Wade ENDEND 
Rereading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame ENDEND  It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country ENDEND  They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fairminded words ENDEND  Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points ENDEND 
So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice ENDEND  The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my prochoice position ENDEND  And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own  a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me ENDEND 
And that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own ENDEND  It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans ENDEND  A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all ENDEND  It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

I said that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless man, but that he posed no imminent and direct threat to the United States ENDEND 
I said that a war in Iraq would take our focus away from our efforts to defeat alQaeda ENDEND 
And, with a volatile mix of ethnic groups and a complicated history, I said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq would require a United States   occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences ENDEND 
In short, I felt the decision unfolding then to invade Iraq was being made without a clear rationale, based more on ideology and politics than fact and reason ENDEND 
It is with no great pleasure that I recall this now ENDEND  Too many young men and women have died ENDEND  Too many have been maimed ENDEND  Too many hearts have been broken ENDEND  I fervently wish I had been wrong about this war; that my concerns had been unfounded ENDEND 
America and the American people have paid a high price for the decision to invade Iraq and myriad mistakes that followed ENDEND  I believe that history will not judge the authors of this war kindly ENDEND 
For all these reasons, I would like nothing more than to support the Kerry Amendment; to bring our brave troops home on a date certain, and spare the American people more pain, suffering and sorrow ENDEND 
But having visited Iraq, I'm also acutely aware that a precipitous withdrawal of our troops, driven by Congressional edict rather than the realities on the ground, will not undo the mistakes made by this Administration ENDEND  It could compound them ENDEND 
It could compound them by plunging Iraq into an even deeper and, perhaps, irreparable crisis ENDEND 
We must exit Iraq, but not in a way that leaves behind a security vacuum filled with terrorism, chaos, ethnic cleansing and genocide that could engulf large swaths of the Middle East and endanger America ENDEND  We have both moral and national security reasons to manage our exit in a responsible way ENDEND 
I share many of the goals set forth in the Kerry Amendment ENDEND  We should send a clear message to the Iraqis that we won't be there forever, and that by next year our primary role should be to conduct counterinsurgency actions, train Iraqi security forces, and provide needed logistical support ENDEND 
Moreover, I share the frustration with an Administration whose policies with respect to Iraq seem to simply repeat the simpleminded refrains of "we know best" and "stay the course ENDEND " It's not acceptable to conduct a war where our goals and strategies drift aimlessly regardless of the cost in lives or dollars spent, and where we end up with arbitrary, polldriven troop reductions by the Administration  the worst of all possible outcomes ENDEND 
As one who strongly opposed the decision to go to war and who has met with servicemen and women injured in this conflict and seen the pain of the parents and loved ones of those who have died in Iraq, I would like nothing more than for our military involvement to end ENDEND 
But I do not believe that setting a date certain for the total withdrawal of United States   troops is the best approach to achieving, in a methodical and responsible way, the three basic goals that should drive our Iraq policy: that is,  stabilizing Iraq and giving the factions within Iraq the space they need to forge a political settlement;  containing and ultimately defeating the insurgency in Iraq; and  bringing our troops safely home ENDEND 
What is needed is a blueprint for an expeditious yet responsible exit from Iraq ENDEND  A hard and fast, arbitrary deadline for withdrawal offers our commanders in the field, and our diplomats in the region, insufficient flexibility to implement that strategy ENDEND 
For example, let's say that a phased withdrawal results in fifty thousand troops in Iraq by July ,  ENDEND  If, at that point, our generals and the Iraqi government tell us that having those troops in Iraq for an additional three or six months would enhance stability and security in the region, this amendment would potentially prevent us from pursuing the optimal policy ENDEND 
It is for this reason that I cannot support the Kerry Amendment ENDEND  Instead, I am a cosponsor of the Levin amendment, which gives us the best opportunity to find this balance between our need to begin a phasedown and our need to help stabilize Iraq ENDEND  It tells the Iraqis that we won't be there forever so that they need to move forward on uniting and securing their country ENDEND  I agree with Senator Warner that the message should be "we really mean business, Iraqis, get on with it ENDEND " At the same time, the amendment also provides the Iraqis the time and the opportunity to accomplish this critical goal ENDEND 
Essential to a successful policy is the Administration listening to its generals and diplomats and members of Congress  especially those who disagree with their policies and believe it is time to start bringing our troops home ENDEND 
The overwhelming majority of the Senate is already on record voting for an amendment stating that calendar year  should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty, with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security, creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq ENDEND  The Levin Amendment builds on this approach ENDEND 
The White House should follow this principle as well ENDEND  Visiting Iraq for a few hours cannot resuscitate or justify a failed policy ENDEND  No amount of spin or photo opportunities can change the bottom line: this war has been poorly conceived and poorly managed by the White House, and that is why it has been so poorly received by the American people ENDEND  ENDEND 
And it's troubling to already see Karl Rove in New Hampshire, treating this as a political attack opportunity instead of a major national challenge around which to rally the country ENDEND 
There are no easy answers to this war ENDEND  I understand that many Americans want to see our troops come home ENDEND  The chaos, violence, and horrors in Iraq are gutwrenching reminders of what our men and women in uniform, some just months out of high school, must confront on a daily basis ENDEND  They are doing this heroically, they are doing this selflessly, and more than , of them have now made the ultimate sacrifice for our country ENDEND 
Not one of us wants to see our servicemen and women in harm's way a day longer than they have to be ENDEND  And that's why we must find the most responsible way to bring them home as quickly as possible, while still leaving the foundation of a secure Iraq that will not endanger the free world ENDEND 

When Ryan was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy ENDEND  His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement ENDEND 
Yet, his parents had hope ENDEND  Because when Ryan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells ENDEND  They found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition ENDEND 
They did ENDEND  In fact, they seem to have cured him ENDEND 
Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just like any other child  a miracle his family had once only dreamed of ENDEND 
Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and lifethreatening diseases and health conditions ENDEND 
Each year, , Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease ENDEND  Over  million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function ENDEND  And there are far too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence ENDEND 
For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries ENDEND 
Until now ENDEND 
Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions ENDEND 
Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the lifesaving applications of adult stem cell research ENDEND  Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of the cancer ENDEND  This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday ENDEND 
Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations ENDEND  Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may not be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells ENDEND 
Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well ENDEND  If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use ENDEND  His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source ENDEND 
These and other difficulties are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem cell research ENDEND 
Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization ENDEND  At this very moment, there are over , embryos being stored in over  facilities throughout the United States ENDEND  The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples ENDEND  However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal ENDEND  We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use and cord blood use ENDEND 
All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research ENDEND  At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and heart damage ENDEND 
At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats ENDEND  One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help those who have lost the ability to walk ENDEND 
For these reasons, I'm proud to be a longterm supporter of greater stem cell research ENDEND  While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Public Health ENDEND 
And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today ENDEND  This bill embodies the innovative thinking that we as a society demand and medical advancement requires ENDEND  By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none ENDEND  But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scientific research also be subject to rigorous oversight ENDEND 
I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate ENDEND  But I also realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about cloning humans ENDEND  We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever  and we're talking about using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans ENDEND 
Democrats want this bill to pass ENDEND  Conservative, prolife Republicans want this bill to pass ENDEND  By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass ENDEND  It is only the White House standing in the way of progress  standing in the way of so many potential cures ENDEND 
I would only ask that the President thinks about this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years ENDEND  I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and his parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure  hoping that somewhere, a researcher or scientist will find the answer ENDEND 
There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands  especially children  disabled for life ENDEND  The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cure, but they needed help  they needed funding to make their research possible ENDEND 
With a world war raging and the country still emerging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own ENDEND 
But that didn't happen ENDEND  Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio ENDEND  And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own ENDEND 
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine ENDEND 
Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today ENDEND  All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today for Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow ENDEND  At the dawn of the st century, we should approach this research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history ENDEND 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom ENDEND  They are the soultrying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and selfinterest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ? making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals ENDEND 
This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord ENDEND  It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg ENDEND  It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism ENDEND 
And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of , and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ? diplomatic, economic, and military ? to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it ENDEND 
In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ? a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful ENDEND 
A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq ENDEND  Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism ENDEND 
Neither turned out to be true ENDEND  And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over ENDEND  That policybyslogan will no longer pass as an acceptable form of debate in this country ENDEND  “Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ? the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ? a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain ENDEND 
, Americans have now died in this war ENDEND  Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime ENDEND  Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived ENDEND  The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ? in North Korea, in Iran, and in Afghanistan ENDEND  And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America ENDEND 
These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ? a strategy no longer driven by ideology and politics, but one that is based on a realistic assessment of the sobering facts on the ground and our interests in the region ENDEND 
This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in  ENDEND  The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy ENDEND  I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences ENDEND 
Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation ENDEND  No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions ENDEND  We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes ENDEND  We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down ENDEND  Last week, without a trace of irony, the President even chose Vietnam as the backdrop for remarks counseling “patience” with his policies in Iraq ENDEND 
When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from Iraqi soil ENDEND  At that point, seventyfive United States   Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that  be a year of significant transition in Iraq ENDEND 
What we have seen instead is a year of significant deterioration ENDEND  A year in which wellrespected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working ENDEND  A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control ENDEND 
According to our own Pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos ENDEND  Sectarian violence has reached an alltime high, and , Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February ENDEND  , Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier ENDEND  The addition of , American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city ENDEND  And polls show that almost twothirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on American soldiers ENDEND 
Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier ENDEND  In just the past three weeks, he has ? and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ? “rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq ENDEND ”
This is now the reality of Iraq ENDEND 
Now, I am hopeful that the Iraq Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus ENDEND  I am committed to working with this White House and any of my colleagues in the months to come to craft such a consensus ENDEND  And I believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war ENDEND 
But it will not be easy ENDEND  For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war ENDEND  There are no options that do not carry significant risks ENDEND  And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq ENDEND  Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security ENDEND 
What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same ENDEND  It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them ENDEND  And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve ENDEND  The American people have been extraordinarily resolved ENDEND  They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah ENDEND  They have spent hundreds of billions of their hardearned dollars on this effort ? money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation ENDEND  No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ? and that strategy must change ENDEND 
It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq ENDEND  Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ? dreams and hopes ENDEND  We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ? namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home ENDEND 
There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq ENDEND  And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either ENDEND  It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own ENDEND  Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war ENDEND 
Let me underscore this point ENDEND  The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question ENDEND  They are doing so today ENDEND  They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq ENDEND  But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war ENDEND  Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes ENDEND  And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace ENDEND 
I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one ENDEND  To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end ENDEND  No more coddling, no more equivocation ENDEND  Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ? military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control ENDEND 
The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ? a phased redeployment of United States   troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months ENDEND 
When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of  ENDEND  Such a timetable may now need to begin in , but begin it must ENDEND  For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the United States   is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq ENDEND 
Let me be more specific ENDEND  The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in United States   forces ENDEND  He should then work with our military commanders to map out the best plan for such a redeployment and determine precise levels and dates ENDEND  When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ? but it should not depend on Iraqi approval ENDEND 
I am not suggesting that this timetable be overlyrigid ENDEND  We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground ENDEND  The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels ENDEND  Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point United States   commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger ENDEND 
Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an overthehorizon force ENDEND  This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region ENDEND 
Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there ENDEND  The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan  we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control ENDEND  Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos ENDEND  By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a muchneeded boost to this critical fight against terrorism ENDEND 
As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the United States   troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists ENDEND 
In such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced United States   force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time ENDEND  But only if United States   commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support ENDEND  We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society ENDEND  Such a reduced but active presence will also send a clear message to hostile countries like Iran and Syria that we intend to remain a key player in this region ENDEND 
The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? especially special forces ? who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers ENDEND 
An increase in the quality and quantity of United States   personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents ENDEND 
Let me emphasize one vital point ? any United States   strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq ENDEND  In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that United States   forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing ENDEND 
Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police ENDEND  We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government ENDEND  The security forces have to be far more inclusive ? standing up an army composed mainly of Shiites and Kurds will only cause the Sunnis to feel more threatened and fight even harder ENDEND 
The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement ENDEND 
So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than  billion dollars in Iraq ENDEND  But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history ENDEND  Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with illconceived, halffinished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country ENDEND 
This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war ENDEND  This means no more bloated nobid contracts that cost the taxpayers millions in overhead and administrative expenses ENDEND 
We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas ENDEND  But we need to also move towards more conditionbased aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement ENDEND 
Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution ENDEND 
This includes opening dialogue with both Syria and Iran, an idea supported by both James Baker and Robert Gates ENDEND  We know these countries want us to fail, and we should remain steadfast in our opposition to their support of terrorism and Iran’s nuclear ambitions ENDEND  But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ? and within their own countries ENDEND 
And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others ENDEND  The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution ENDEND 
Make no mistake ? if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken ENDEND  It is in our national interest to prevent this from happening ENDEND  We should also make it clear that, even after we begin to drawdown forces, we will still work with our allies in the region to combat international terrorism and prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction ENDEND  It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us ENDEND 
This brings me to a set of broader points ENDEND  As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism ENDEND 
Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation ENDEND  But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided ENDEND  And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century ENDEND 
The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force ENDEND  In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today ENDEND  This doesn’t mean abandoning our values and ideals; wherever we can, it’s in our interest to help foster democracy through the diplomatic and economic resources at our disposal ENDEND  But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ? free markets, a free press, a strong civil society ? cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun ENDEND  And so we must realize that the freedoms FDR once spoke of ? especially freedom from want and freedom from fear ? do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well ENDEND 
The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success ENDEND  Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell ENDEND  Such lack of foresight is simply inexcusable ENDEND  If we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home ENDEND 
The final lesson is that in an interconnected world, the defeat of international terrorism ? and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction  will require the cooperation of many nations ENDEND  We must always reserve the right to strike unilaterally at terrorists wherever they may exist ENDEND  But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions ENDEND  This means talking to our friends and, at times, even our enemies ENDEND 
We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq ENDEND 
The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism ENDEND  But there are many others ENDEND 
The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world ENDEND  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere ENDEND  In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda ENDEND  And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way ENDEND 
There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people ENDEND  According to a Pew survey,  of Americans now agree with the statement that the United States   should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own ENDEND ”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now ENDEND   showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us ENDEND  And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world ENDEND 
But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ? a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality ENDEND 
Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago ENDEND  It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust ENDEND  I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today ENDEND  I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing ENDEND 
There have been too many speeches ENDEND  There have been too many excuses ENDEND  There have been too many flagdraped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families ENDEND 
The time for waiting in Iraq is over ENDEND  It is time to change our policy ENDEND  It is time to give Iraqis their country back ENDEND  And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

The first time I came to Kenya was in  ENDEND  I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in lowincome neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school ENDEND  My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month ENDEND 
My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip ENDEND  Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old ENDEND  When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road ENDEND  I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small teahouse in downtown Nairobi ENDEND  When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap ENDEND 
But it was a magical trip ENDEND  To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess  their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty ENDEND  I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left ENDEND 
And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him ENDEND 
I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life ENDEND  I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles ENDEND 
I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult ENDEND  I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled  from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya ENDEND  In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation ENDEND 
And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments ENDEND  His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years ENDEND  And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family  because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did  his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well ENDEND 
In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole ENDEND  The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure selfdetermination in the face of great odds ENDEND 
But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential  that the hopefulness of the postcolonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIVAIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict ENDEND 
One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise ENDEND  In early 's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea ENDEND  Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's ENDEND 
How can we explain this fact? Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans  we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families ENDEND  We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country ENDEND  And we know how much this land is blessed  just as the entire African continent is blessed  with great gifts and riches ENDEND 
So what explains this? I believe there a number of factors at work ENDEND 
Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances ENDEND  It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife ENDEND 
Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation ENDEND  This means that the education and health care systems  issues that my own nation more than  years old still struggles with  lag behind, impacting its development ENDEND 
Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world  disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade ENDEND  When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system ENDEND  And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand ENDEND  It never did, and it never will ENDEND " As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies ENDEND  This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth ENDEND  Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors ENDEND 
As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and selfinterest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa ENDEND  And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity ENDEND  A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent ENDEND 
But, Kenya must do its part ENDEND  It cannot wait for other nations to act first ENDEND  The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their selfinterest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind ENDEND 
It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind ENDEND  Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable ENDEND  One that serves its people and is free from corruption ENDEND 
There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring ENDEND  Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy  a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability ENDEND  You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability ENDEND 
And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy ENDEND  It is being threatened by corruption ENDEND 
Corruption is not a new problem ENDEND  It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem ENDEND  It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society ENDEND  My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections ENDEND  In just the last year, our own United States   Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain ENDEND 
But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis  a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for  the opportunity they deserve ENDEND 
I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country,  of Kenyans still live in poverty ENDEND  And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this ENDEND 
It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development  it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health ENDEND  It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their jobcreating ideas off the ground ENDEND  In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms  of their revenues, the difference between goodpaying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else ENDEND  And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort ENDEND 
Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate ENDEND  It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises  whether it's the HIVAIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought ENDEND 
What's worse  corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions ENDEND 
It can shield a war criminal  even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide  by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice ENDEND 
Terrorist attacks  like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy  are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive ENDEND 
Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism ENDEND  Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust ENDEND 
In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists  to protect them and to promote their common welfare  all else is lost ENDEND  And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time ENDEND 
The good news is that there are already signs of progress here ENDEND  Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya ENDEND  The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue ENDEND 
Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of  ENDEND  This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures  the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth  were all promising ENDEND 
But elections are not enough ENDEND  In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people ENDEND 
Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country ENDEND  The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels ENDEND 
And so we know that there is more work to be done  more reforms to be made ENDEND  I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start ENDEND 
We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job ENDEND  And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe ENDEND  So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy  to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful  it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials ENDEND 
Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs ENDEND  And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent  when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan  there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests ENDEND  Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption ENDEND 
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not ENDEND  Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place ENDEND 
Finally, ethnicbased tribal politics has to stop ENDEND  It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good ENDEND  It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society ENDEND  Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing ENDEND  Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor ENDEND 
An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle ENDEND  When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow  everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups ENDEND 
Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see ENDEND  The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses ENDEND 
The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya ENDEND  But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here  Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid ENDEND  As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction ENDEND  And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be ENDEND 
By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite  they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future ENDEND  By focusing on building strong, independent institutions  like an anticorruption commission with real authority  rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives ENDEND  They fight the fight of our time ENDEND 
Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too ENDEND 
You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way ENDEND 
You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone  regardless of ethnicity or of wealth ENDEND 
And you will determine the direction of this country in the st century  whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together ENDEND 
This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned  all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today ENDEND 
I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task  an effort bigger than you can imagine  but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see ENDEND 
As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well  he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young ENDEND  Since that time I have known him through stories  those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country ENDEND 
I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man  that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime ENDEND 
As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments ENDEND  We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future ENDEND 
In today's Kenya  a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day  it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve ENDEND  I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

He's absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its oversight responsibilities, and one way to reverse that troubling trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill ENDEND  We did that in the Patriot Act, and that allowed us to make important revisions to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and didn't work during the previous  years ENDEND  We should do that again with this important piece of legislation ENDEND 
But I want to take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us ENDEND 
I may have only been in this body for a short while, but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here ENDEND  I realize that soon, we will adjourn for the fall, and the campaigning will begin in earnest ENDEND  And there will be second attack ads and negative mail pieces, and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans ENDEND  And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire ENDEND 
And yet, while I know all of this, I'm still disappointed ENDEND  Because what we're doing here today  a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused  should be bigger than politics ENDEND  This is serious ENDEND 
If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences  heartfelt convictions that couldn't be settled by compromise  I would understand ENDEND  But it's not ENDEND 
All of us  Democrats and Republicans  want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible ENDEND  All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this ENDEND  And all of us were willing to do that in this bill ENDEND  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people ENDEND 
In the five years that the President's system of military tribunals has existed, not one terrorist has been tried ENDEND  Not one has been convicted ENDEND  And in the end, the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional, which is why we're here today ENDEND 
We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay ENDEND  Easily ENDEND  This was not an eitheror question ENDEND 
Instead of allowing this President  or any President  to decide what does and does not constitute torture, we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions, as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered ENDEND 
Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer, we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused ENDEND 
And instead of not just suspending, but eliminating, the right of habeas corpus  the seven centuryold right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention, we could have given the accused one chance  one single chance  to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with ENDEND 
But politics won today ENDEND  Politics won ENDEND  The Administration got its vote, and now it will have its victory lap, and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists ENDEND 
And yet, we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of  his day in court, but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists  people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives ENDEND 
And yet, we have a report authored by sixteen of our own government's intelligence agencies, a previous draft of which described, and I quote, " ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement, like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND "
And yet, we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way ENDEND  We have a war in Iraq that our own government's intelligence says is serving as Al Qaeda's best recruitment tool ENDEND  And we have recommendations from the bipartisan  commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact ENDEND 
The problem with this bill is not that it's too tough on terrorists ENDEND  The problem with this bill is that it's sloppy ENDEND  And the reason it's sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right ENDEND 
I've heard, for example, the argument that it should be military courts, and not federal judges, who should make decisions on these detainees ENDEND  I actually agree with that ENDEND  The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through ENDEND  Indeed, the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees, which should have been issued months ago, still haven't been issued ENDEND  Instead, we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court ENDEND 
This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism ENDEND  I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern ENDEND  He's absolutely right it should be our primary concern  which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation ENDEND 
Now, let me be clear  for those who plot terror against the United States, I hope God has mercy on their soul, because I certainly do not ENDEND  And for those who our government suspects of terror, I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot ENDEND 
But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever ENDEND  We've already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldn't have been there  as one United States   commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal, "Sometimes, we just didn't get the right folks ENDEND " And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections, detained in New York, sent to Syria, and tortured, only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information ENDEND 
In the future, people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence ENDEND  They may remain locked away forever ENDEND 
And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary ENDEND  We could've drafted a bipartisan, wellstructured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts, had an effective review process that would've prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts, but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great ENDEND 
Instead, what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of ENDEND  And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November th ENDEND 
That is not how we should be doing business in the United States   Senate, and that's not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism ENDEND  When we're sloppy and cut corners, we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war ENDEND  At bare minimum, I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND Super Tuesday
Chicago, IL
February , 
Before I begin, I just want to send my condolences to the victims of the storms that hit Tennessee and Arkansas ENDEND  They are in our thoughts and in our prayers ENDEND 
Well, the polls are just closing in California and the votes are still being counted in cities and towns across the country ENDEND  But there is one thing on this February night that we do not need the final results to know  our time has come, our movement is real, and change is coming to America ENDEND 
Only a few hundred miles from here, almost one year ago to the day, we stood on the steps of the Old State Capitol to reaffirm a truth that was spoken there so many generations ago  that a house divided cannot stand; that we are more than a collection of Red States and Blue States; we are, and always will be, the United States of America ENDEND 
What began as a whisper in Springfield soon carried across the corn fields of Iowa, where farmers and factory workers; students and seniors stood up in numbers we've never seen ENDEND  They stood up to say that maybe this year, we don't have to settle for a politics where scoring points is more important than solving problems ENDEND  This time we can finally do something about health care we can't afford or mortgages we can't pay ENDEND  This time can be different ENDEND 
Their voices echoed from the hills of New Hampshire to the deserts of Nevada, where teachers and cooks and kitchen workers stood up to say that maybe Washington doesn't have to be run by lobbyists anymore ENDEND  They reached the coast of South Carolina when people said that maybe we don't have to be divided by race and region and gender; that crumbling schools are stealing the future of black children and white children; that we can come together and build an America that gives every child, everywhere the opportunity to live their dreams ENDEND  This time can be different ENDEND 
And today, on this Tuesday in February, in states North and South, East and West, what began as a whisper in Springfield has swelled to a chorus of millions calling for change ENDEND  A chorus that cannot be ignored ENDEND  That cannot be deterred ENDEND  This time can be different because this campaign for the presidency is different ENDEND 
It's different not because of me, but because of you ENDEND  Because you are tired of being disappointed and tired of being let down ENDEND  You're tired of hearing promises made and plans proposed in the heat of a campaign only to have nothing change when everyone goes back to Washington ENDEND  Because the lobbyists just write another check ENDEND  Or because politicians start worrying about how they'll win the next election instead of why they should ENDEND  Or because they focus on who's up and who's down instead of who matters ENDEND 
And while Washington is consumed with the same drama and division and distraction, another family puts up a For Sale sign in the front yard ENDEND  Another factory shuts its doors ENDEND  Another soldier waves goodbye as he leaves on another tour of duty in a war that should've never been authorized and never been waged ENDEND  It goes on and on and on ENDEND 
But in this election  at this moment  you are standing up all across this country to say, not this time ENDEND  Not this year ENDEND  The stakes are too high and the challenges too great to play the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expect a different result ENDEND  This time must be different ENDEND 
Now, this isn't about me and it's not about Senator Clinton ENDEND  As I've said before, she was a friend before this campaign and she'll be a friend after it's over ENDEND  I respect her as a colleague, and I congratulate her on her victories tonight ENDEND 
But this fall we owe the American people a real choice ENDEND  It's change versus more of the same ENDEND  It's the future versus the past ENDEND 
It's a choice between going into this election with Republicans and Independents already united against us, or going against their nominee with a campaign that has united Americans of all parties around a common purpose ENDEND 
It's a choice between having a debate with the other party about who has the most experience in Washington, or having one about who's most likely to change Washington ENDEND  Because that's a debate we can win ENDEND 
It's a choice between a candidate who's taken more money from Washington lobbyists than either Republican in this race, and a campaign that hasn't taken a dime of their money because we've been funded by you ENDEND 
And if I am your nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that I voted for the war in Iraq; or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran; or that I support the BushCheney policy of not talking to leaders we don't like ENDEND  And he will not be able to say that I wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it's ok for America to use torture  because it is never ok ENDEND  That is the choice in this election ENDEND 
The Republicans running for President have already tied themselves to the past ENDEND  They speak of a hundred year war in Iraq and billions more on tax breaks for the wealthiest few who don't need them and didn't ask for them  tax breaks that mortgage our children's future on a mountain of debt at a time when there are families who can't pay their medical bills and students who can't pay their tuition ENDEND 
They are running on the politics of yesterday, and that is why our party must be the party of tomorrow ENDEND  And that is the party I will lead as President ENDEND 
I'll be the President who ends the tax breaks to companies that ship our jobs overseas and start putting them in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it ENDEND  And struggling homeowners ENDEND  And seniors who should retire with dignity and respect ENDEND 
I'll be the President who finally brings Democrats and Republicans together to make health care affordable and available for every single American ENDEND  We will put a college education within reach of anyone who wants to go, and instead of just talking about how great our teachers are, we will reward them for their greatness, with more pay and better support ENDEND  And we will harnesses the ingenuity of farmers and scientists and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil once and for all ENDEND 
And when I am President, we will put an end to a politics that uses  as a way to scare up votes, and start seeing it as a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the twentyfirst century: terrorism and nuclear weapons; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease ENDEND 
We can do this ENDEND  It will not be easy ENDEND  It will require struggle and sacrifice ENDEND  There will setbacks and we will make mistakes ENDEND  And that is why we need all the help we can get ENDEND  So tonight I want to speak directly to all those Americans who have yet to join this movement but still hunger for change  we need you ENDEND  We need you to stand with us, and work with us, and help us prove that together, ordinary people can still do extraordinary things ENDEND 
I am blessed to be standing in the city where my own extraordinary journey began ENDEND  A few miles from here, in the shadow of a shuttered steel plant, is where I learned what it takes to make change happen ENDEND 
I was a young organizer then, intent on fighting joblessness and poverty on the South Side, and I still remember one of the very first meetings I put together ENDEND  We had worked on it for days, but no one showed up ENDEND  Our volunteers felt so defeated, they wanted to quit ENDEND  And to be honest, so did I ENDEND 
But at that moment, I looked outside and saw some young boys tossing stones at a boardedup apartment building across the street ENDEND  They were like boys in so many cities across the country  boys without prospects, without guidance, without hope ENDEND  And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question ENDEND  What will happen to those boys?" And the volunteers looked out that window, and they decided that night to keep going  to keep organizing, keep fighting for better schools, and better jobs, and better health care ENDEND  And so did I ENDEND  And slowly, but surely, in the weeks and months to come, the community began to change ENDEND 
You see, the challenges we face will not be solved with one meeting in one night ENDEND  Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time ENDEND 
We are the ones we've been waiting for ENDEND  We are the change that we seek ENDEND  We are the hope of those boys who have little; who've been told that they cannot have what they dream; that they cannot be what they imagine ENDEND 
Yes they can ENDEND 
We are the hope of the father who goes to work before dawn and lies awake with doubts that tell him he cannot give his children the same opportunities that someone gave him ENDEND 
Yes he can ENDEND 
We are the hope of the woman who hears that her city will not be rebuilt; that she cannot reclaim the life that was swept away in a terrible storm ENDEND 
Yes she can ENDEND 
We are the hope of the future; the answer to the cynics who tell us our house must stand divided; that we cannot come together; that we cannot remake this world as it should be ENDEND 
Because we know what we have seen and what we believe  that what began as a whisper has now swelled to a chorus that cannot be ignored; that will not be deterred; that will ring out across this land as a hymn that will heal this nation, repair this world, and make this time different than all the rest  Yes ENDEND  We ENDEND  Can ENDEND 

Good morning ENDEND  I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference ENDEND  I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America ENDEND  It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country ENDEND  So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington ENDEND 
But today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years ENDEND 
I do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America ENDEND  We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle headon the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America ENDEND 
I want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact ENDEND  As some of you know, during the  United States   Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes ENDEND  Mr. Keyes is wellversed in the Jerry FalwellPat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless ENDEND 
Indeed, Mr. Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, "Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama ENDEND  Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved ENDEND "
Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama ENDEND 
Now, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it ENDEND  To them, Mr. Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining ENDEND  And since at the time, I was up  points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice ENDEND 
But what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr. Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God ENDEND  He claimed knowledge of certain truths ENDEND 
Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination ENDEND 
Mr. Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life ENDEND 
And so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr. Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?
Unwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates  namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the United States   Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois ENDEND 
But Mr. Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs ENDEND 
Now, my dilemma was by no means unique ENDEND  In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics ENDEND 
For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines ENDEND  Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in socalled Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't ENDEND 
Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design ENDEND 
Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait ENDEND  At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that  regardless of our personal beliefs  constitutional principles tie our hands ENDEND  At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith ENDEND 
Now, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes ENDEND  But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives  in the lives of the American people  and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy ENDEND 
And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people ENDEND   percent of us believe in God,  percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion,  percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution ENDEND 
This religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular megachurches ENDEND  In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that  a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause ENDEND 
Each day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds  dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets  and they're coming to the realization that something is missing ENDEND  They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough ENDEND 
They want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives ENDEND  They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before ENDEND  And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them  that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness ENDEND 
And I speak with some experience on this matter ENDEND  I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were ENDEND  My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist ENDEND  My mother, whose parents were nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself ENDEND  As a consequence, so did I ENDEND 
It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma ENDEND 
I was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me ENDEND  They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs ENDEND  But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst ENDEND 
And in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well  that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone ENDEND 
And if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate ENDEND  But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn  not just to work with the church, but to be in the church ENDEND 
For one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the AfricanAmerican religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today ENDEND  Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities ENDEND  And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world ENDEND  As a source of hope ENDEND 
And perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship  the grounding of faith in struggle  that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today ENDEND 
Faith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts ENDEND 
You need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it ENDEND  You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away  because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey ENDEND 
It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith ENDEND  It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany ENDEND  I didn't fall out in church ENDEND  The questions I had didn't magically disappear ENDEND  But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me ENDEND  I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth ENDEND 
That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans  evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives ENDEND  It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values ENDEND  In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values ENDEND 
And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at  to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own  then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse ENDEND 
Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome  others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends ENDEND 
In other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway ENDEND 
More fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms ENDEND  Some of the problem here is rhetorical  if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice ENDEND 
Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to "the judgments of the Lord ENDEND " Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to "all of God's children ENDEND " Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny ENDEND 
Our failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though ENDEND  Our fear of getting "preachy" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems ENDEND 
After all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan ENDEND  They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness  in the imperfections of man ENDEND 
Solving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds ENDEND  I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby  but I also believe that when a gangbanger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem ENDEND  There's a hole in that young man's heart  a hole that the government alone cannot fix ENDEND 
I believe in vigorous enforcement of our nondiscrimination laws ENDEND  But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers ENDEND  They have more lawyers than us anyway ENDEND 
I think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys ENDEND  I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth ENDEND  I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished ENDEND 
But, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it ENDEND  So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy ENDEND 
I am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology  that can be dangerous ENDEND  Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith ENDEND  As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap  off rhythm  to the choir ENDEND  We don't need that ENDEND 
In fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not ENDEND  They don't need to do that ENDEND  None of us need to do that ENDEND 
But what I am suggesting is this  secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square ENDEND  Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King  indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history  were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause ENDEND  So to say that men and women should not inject their "personal morality" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity ENDEND  Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the JudeoChristian tradition ENDEND 
Moreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country ENDEND  We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of "thou" and not just "I," resonates in religious congregations all across the country ENDEND  And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal ENDEND 
Some of this is already beginning to happen ENDEND  Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and T ENDEND D ENDEND  Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur ENDEND  Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality ENDEND 
And by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax ENDEND  When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate ENDEND 
Across the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping exoffenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina ENDEND 
So the question is, how do we build on these stilltentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far ENDEND  The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed ENDEND  And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration ENDEND 
While I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do  some truths they need to acknowledge ENDEND 
For one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice ENDEND  Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment ENDEND  It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves ENDEND  It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want statesponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it ENDEND 
Moreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater ENDEND  Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers ENDEND 
And even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every nonChristian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount  a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles ENDEND  Folks haven't been reading their bibles ENDEND 
This brings me to my second point ENDEND  Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religionspecific, values ENDEND  It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason ENDEND  I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will ENDEND  I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all ENDEND 
Now this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do ENDEND  But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice ENDEND  Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality ENDEND  It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible ENDEND  At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise ENDEND  It's the art of the impossible ENDEND  If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences ENDEND  To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing ENDEND  And if you doubt that, let me give you an example ENDEND 
We all know the story of Abraham and Isaac ENDEND  Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded ENDEND 
Of course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion ENDEND 
But it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham ENDEND  We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be ENDEND  So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason ENDEND 
Finally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion ENDEND 
This goes for both sides ENDEND 
Even those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages  the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity  are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life ENDEND 
The American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it ENDEND  Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics ENDEND 
But a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state ENDEND  Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation  context matters ENDEND  It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase "under God ENDEND " I didn't ENDEND  Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats ENDEND  And one can envision certain faithbased programs  targeting exoffenders or substance abusers  that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems ENDEND 
So we all have some work to do here ENDEND  But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate ENDEND  And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen ENDEND  No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack ENDEND  They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide ENDEND  They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon ENDEND  Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives ENDEND 
So let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign ENDEND  A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my United States   Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:
"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win ENDEND  I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election ENDEND  I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you ENDEND "
The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be "totalizing ENDEND " His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda ENDEND 
But the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion ENDEND  Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my website, which suggested that I would fight "rightwing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose ENDEND " The doctor went on to write:
"I sense that you have a strong sense of justice ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND and I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND Whatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fairminded ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND You know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve others ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fairminded words ENDEND "
Fairminded words ENDEND 
So I looked at my website and found the offending words ENDEND  In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my prochoice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v ENDEND  Wade ENDEND 
Rereading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame ENDEND  It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country ENDEND  They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fairminded words ENDEND  Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points ENDEND 
So I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice ENDEND  The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my prochoice position ENDEND  And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own  a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me ENDEND 
And that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own ENDEND  It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans ENDEND  A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all ENDEND  It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

Thank you ENDEND  Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America ENDEND 
My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history ENDEND 
It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country ENDEND  Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change ENDEND 
These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible  they just don't think their leaders do ENDEND  These are Americans who still dream big dreams they just sense their leaders have forgotten how ENDEND 
I remember when I first ran for the state Senate  my very first race ENDEND  A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running ENDEND  Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife ENDEND 
And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does  I talked to anyone who'd listen ENDEND 
I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature ENDEND  And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it ENDEND  They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama ENDEND " And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya ENDEND 
And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man ENDEND 
You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man  why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today ENDEND  That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives ENDEND 
So I understand the cynicism ENDEND  But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate ENDEND 
We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live ENDEND  And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand ENDEND 
And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked ENDEND 
And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in  and was  years old ENDEND 
And ever since I met this frail, onehundredandfiveyearold AfricanAmerican woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life ENDEND 
I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky ENDEND  That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways ENDEND  That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was ENDEND 
I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus ENDEND 
And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote ENDEND  And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security ENDEND  How she saw unions rise up and a middleclass prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America ENDEND 
She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn ENDEND  And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn ENDEND "
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom ENDEND  And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed ENDEND  She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation ENDEND 
And at last  at last  she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act ENDEND 
And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time  and she got in that line  and she never forgot it ENDEND  She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed ENDEND  She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America ENDEND 
She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few ENDEND 
And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused ENDEND  Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are ENDEND  Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream ENDEND 
And I think that we face one of those moments today ENDEND 
In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middleclass dream, and scandal and corruption in our government ENDEND 
The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe ENDEND  And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers ENDEND 
No longer can we assume that a highschool education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a collegeeducated student in Bangalore or Beijing ENDEND  No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottomlines know no borders ENDEND  Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil ENDEND 
The world has changed ENDEND  And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas ENDEND  We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket ENDEND  We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on  ENDEND 
But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still ENDEND  Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again ENDEND 
It's the timidity  the smallness  of our politics that's holding us back right now ENDEND  The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away ENDEND 
That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams ENDEND 
That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly , flagdraped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base ENDEND 
Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore ENDEND 
You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago ENDEND  He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here ENDEND  Because I think we've all had enough ENDEND  Enough of the broken promises ENDEND  Enough of the failed leadership ENDEND  Enough of the can'tdo, won'tdo, won'teventry style of governance ENDEND 
Four years after , I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders ENDEND 
I've had enough of the closeddoor deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the  million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills ENDEND 
I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country ENDEND  I've had enough of that ENDEND 
I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia ENDEND 
I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers ENDEND  I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers ENDEND  And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country ENDEND 
You know, we all remember that George Bush said in  campaign that he was against nationbuilding ENDEND  We just didn't know he was talking about this one ENDEND 
Now, let me say this  I don't think that George Bush is a bad man ENDEND  I think he loves his country ENDEND  I don't think this administration is full of stupid people  I think there are a lot of smart folks in there ENDEND  The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to  it's that it is ENDEND  It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do ENDEND 
The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem ENDEND  That we're better off if we dismantle it  if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND 
It's called the Ownership Society in Washington ENDEND  But in our past there has been another term for it  Social Darwinism  every man or women for him or herself ENDEND 
It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford  life isn't fair ENDEND  It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb  pick yourself up by your bootstraps ENDEND  It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China  we're sorry, but you're on your own ENDEND 
It's a bracing idea ENDEND  It's a tempting idea ENDEND  And it's the easiest thing in the world ENDEND 
But there's just one problem ENDEND  It doesn't work ENDEND  It ignores our history ENDEND  Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market ENDEND  But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility ENDEND  The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity ENDEND 
Americans know this ENDEND  We know that government can't solve all our problems  and we don't want it to ENDEND 
But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own ENDEND  We know that there are some things we do better together ENDEND 
We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper ENDEND  That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other ENDEND 
That's what America is ENDEND 
And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about ENDEND 
Because I think that this is our moment to lead ENDEND 
The time for our party's identity crisis is over ENDEND  Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves ENDEND  We know who we are ENDEND  And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough ENDEND 
So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity ENDEND  That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive  we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, worldclass, topnotch, lifelong education  from early childhood to high school, from college to onthejob training ENDEND 
Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans ENDEND  The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families ENDEND  The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford ENDEND 
Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America ENDEND  The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies ENDEND  The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuelefficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes ENDEND 
Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances ENDEND  And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win ENDEND 
And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check ENDEND  The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot ENDEND 
If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda ENDEND  Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans ENDEND  We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears ENDEND 
Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership ENDEND  They are longing for direction ENDEND  And they want to believe again ENDEND  A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America ENDEND 
At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school ENDEND  The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding ENDEND 
Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story ENDEND  And she began to cry ENDEND  When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing ENDEND  I did not need sewing either ENDEND  I knew how to sew ENDEND  My mother is a seamstress in a factory ENDEND  I'm trying to go to college ENDEND  I don't need to sew to go to college ENDEND  My mother sews ENDEND  I hoped for something else ENDEND "
I hoped for something else ENDEND 
I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too ENDEND 
And I've wondered  if she is lucky enough to live as long as yearold Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twentyfirst century, what will she see? Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in? Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country? Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?
We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions  to forge our own destiny  to begin the world anew ENDEND 
Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time ENDEND 
Our time to make a mark on history ENDEND 
Our time to write a new chapter in the American story ENDEND 
Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up ENDEND 
And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose ENDEND 
They can say that this was the time when America found its way ENDEND 
They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again ENDEND 

The topic today is net neutrality ENDEND  The internet today is an open platform where the demand for websites and services dictates success ENDEND  You've got barriers to entry that are low and equal for all comers ENDEND  And it's because the internet is a neutral platform that I can put on this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through some corporate media middleman ENDEND  I can say what I want without censorship ENDEND  I don't have to pay a special charge ENDEND  But the big telephone and cable companies want to change the internet as we know it ENDEND  They say they want to create highspeed lanes on the internet and strike exclusive contractual arrangements with internet contentproviders for access to those highspeed lanes ENDEND  Those of us who can't pony up the cash for these highspeed connections will be relegated to the slow lanes ENDEND 
Allowing the Bells and cable companies to act as gatekeepers with control over internet access would make the internet like cable ENDEND  A producerdriven market with barriers to entry for website creators and preferential treatment for specific sites based not on merit, the number of hits, but on relationships with the corporate gatekeeper ENDEND  If there were four or more competitive providers of broadband service to every home, then cable and telephone companies would not be able to create a bidding war for access to the highspeed lanes ENDEND  But here's the problem ENDEND  More than  percent of households get their broadband services from either cable or a telephone company ENDEND 
So here's my view ENDEND  We can't have a situation in which the corporate duopoly dictates the future of the internet and that's why I'm supporting what is called net neutrality ENDEND  In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Judiciary Committee reached different conclusions on network neutrality ENDEND  Judiciary Committee members voted to protect net neutrality and commerce voted with the Bells and cable ENDEND  That debate is going to hit the House floor this Friday ENDEND  In the Senate, Senators Snowe and Dorgan are leading the fight for net neutrality and I've joined in that effort ENDEND  Senator Inouye, the ranking Democrat of the Commerce Committee, has joined us in this effort as well and he's working with Senator Stevens to put strong network neutrality into any Senate bill that comes before us ENDEND  There is widespread support among consumer groups, leading academics and the most innovative internet companies, including Google and Yahoo, in favor of net neutrality ENDEND  And part of the reason for that is companies like Google and Yahoo might never have gotten started had they not been in a position to easily access the internet and do so on the same terms as the big corporate companies that were interested in making money on the internet ENDEND 
I know if you are listening to this podcast that you are going to take an intense interest in this issue as well ENDEND  Congress is going to need to hear your voice because the Bell and cable companies are going to be dedicating millions of dollars to defeating network neutrality ENDEND  So I'll keep you updated on this important issue and I look forward to talking to you guys again next week ENDEND  

I come to the floor today to discuss the bipartisan employment verification system amendment that Senators Grassley, Kennedy, Kyl, and I have introduced ENDEND 
One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement, and this bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border security ENDEND  But that's not enough ENDEND  Real enforcement also means drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration ENDEND  And that can only happen if employers don't hire illegal workers ENDEND  Unfortunately, our current employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work ENDEND 
Overall, the number of workplace arrests of illegal immigrants fell from , in  to  in , even as illegal immigration grew during that time ENDEND  Moreover, between  to  of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas ENDEND  And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce access to employment ENDEND 
When Congress last passed an immigration bill in , we didn't provide a meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to work ENDEND  Currently, employees can prove their legal status by showing a variety of documents, and employers are supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filling out an I form for each employee ENDEND  As a result, the market for fraudulent documents  fake Social Security cards, driver's licenses, birth certificates  has exploded ENDEND 
But, with more than  million employees in more than  million workplaces, and only about  Wage and Hour investigators, employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to maintain records, not a serious risk of penalties ENDEND  As a result, the number of "intent to fine" notices issued to employers for hiring undocumented workers dropped from  in  to just three in  ENDEND 
Understandably, employers cannot always detect forged documents ENDEND  And employers who reject workers with questionable documents risk an employment discrimination suit ENDEND 
That's why we need a better alternative ENDEND  We need an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the use of fraudulent documents, significantly reduce the employment of illegal workers, and give employers the confidence that their workforce is legal ENDEND 
When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration reform in April, the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating a national employment eligibility verification system ENDEND  Senators Grassley, Kyl, and I all thought that was a good idea in theory, but we had concerns with the design of the system ENDEND 
Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification system be implemented nationally within  months ENDEND 
Senators Kennedy and I proposed that the system be phased in over five years but that it also include additional accuracy and privacy standards, as well as strict prohibitions on use of the system to discriminate against workers ENDEND 
For the past few weeks, our staffs have worked together in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns of both proposals into consideration ENDEND  I'm pleased that we've reached an agreement ENDEND 
Under our compromise amendment, all employers would have to participate  months after the Department of Homeland Security receives the appropriations needed to fund the system ENDEND  All new employees hired would have to be run through the system, and a series of privacy and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from errors in the system and breaches of private information ENDEND 
And to make sure that employers take the system seriously, we strengthen civil penalties for employers who hire unauthorized workers, and we establish criminal penalties for repeat violators ENDEND 
We've worked in a constructive, bipartisan manner to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough on illegal workers ENDEND  This is a good amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it ENDEND 

Today, we take up the valuable time of the United States   Senate with a proposed amendment to our Constitution that has absolutely no chance of passing ENDEND 
We do this, allegedly, in an attempt to uphold the institution of marriage in this country ENDEND  We do this despite the fact that for over two hundred years, Americans have been defining and defending marriage on the state and local level without any help from the United States   Constitution at all ENDEND 
And yet, we're here anyway because it's an election year  because the party in power has decided that the best way to get voters to the polls is not by talking about Iraq or health care or energy or education, but about a constitutional ban on samesex marriage that they have no chance of passing ENDEND 
Now, I realize that for some Americans, this is an important issue ENDEND  And I should say that personally, I do believe that marriage is between a man and a woman ENDEND 
But let's be honest ENDEND  That's not what this debate is about ENDEND  Not at this time ENDEND 
This debate is an attempt to break a consensus that is quietly being forged in this country ENDEND  It's a consensus between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, Red States and Blue States, that it's time for new leadership in this country  leadership that will stop dividing us, stop disappointing us, and start addressing the problems facing most Americans ENDEND 
It's a consensus between a majority of Americans who say, "You know what, maybe some of us are comfortable with gay marriage right now and some of us are not ENDEND  But most of us do believe that gay couples should be able to visit each other in the hospital and share health care benefits; most of us do believe that they should be treated with dignity and have their privacy respected by the federal government ENDEND "
And we all know that if this amendment were to pass, it would close the door on much of this  because we know that when similar amendments passed in places like Ohio and Michigan and Utah, domestic partnership benefits were taken away from gay couples ENDEND 
This is not what the majority of the American people want ENDEND  And this is not about trying to build consensus in this country; it's not about trying to bring people together ENDEND 
This is about winning an election ENDEND  That's why the issue was last raised in July of , and that's why we haven't heard about it again until now ENDEND  And while this is supposedly a measure that the other party raised to appeal to some of its core supporters, I don't know how happy I'd be if my party only talked about an issue I cared about right around election time  especially if they knew it had no chance of passing ENDEND 
I agree with most Americans, with Democrats and Republicans, with Vice President Cheney, with over , religious leaders of all different beliefs, that decisions about marriage, as they always have, should be left to the states ENDEND 
Today, we should take this amendment only for what it is  a political ploy designed to rally a few supporters and draw the country's attention away from this leadership's past failures and America's future challenges ENDEND 
There is plenty of work to be done in this country ENDEND  There are millions without health care and skyrocketing gas prices and children in crumbling schools and thousands of young Americans risking their lives in Iraq ENDEND 
So don't tell me that this is the best use of our time ENDEND  Don't tell me that this is what people want to see talked about on TV and in the newspapers all day ENDEND  We wonder why the American people have such a low opinion of Washington these days ENDEND  This is why ENDEND 
We are better than this ENDEND  And we certainly owe the American people more than this ENDEND  I know that this amendment will fail, and when it does, I hope we can start discussing issues and offering proposals that will actually improve the lives of most Americans ENDEND 

For more than two years now, we have been watching a rolling genocide take place in Darfur, western Sudan ENDEND  Many of you I'm sure are aware of the tragedy that has been unfolding there ENDEND  For those of you who are not, essentially what we have seen is a systematic targeting on the part of the Khartoum government and the Janjaweed Arab militia that have systematically uprooted, killed, murdered, pillaged, raped, Africans, driven them from their homes into enormous displacedperson camps ENDEND  Refugee camps, within Sudan ENDEND  It's estimated that at least , people have been killed ENDEND  It's known that at least  million people have been displaced ENDEND  The administration early on in this tragedy acknowledged that this was genocide that was taking place ENDEND  I think there has been broad recognition in the international community that the behavior of the Sudanese government has been scandalous ENDEND  The rationale that has provided from the Sudanese government for what has been taking place is that there is a battle going on between Sudanese government and rebels that operate within the area ENDEND  But, the real victims have not been rebel sympathizers, or the rebels themselves, they've been innocent men, women and children ENDEND 
For more than a year now, I've been working with other Senators to see what we can do to really push the Administration to take this as seriously as it warrants ENDEND  To the Administration's credit, the United States government has probably paid more attention to this issue than some of our European allies ENDEND  We have been a major contributor of aid to the region; we have helped to finance the African Union, to provide peacekeeping forces in the Darfur area ENDEND  So, in a lot of ways, the United States government has been much more on top of this than Europeans, Canadians, and others, who oftentimes accuse the Untied States of being indifferent to the problems of the third world ENDEND  On the other hand, what has been done is not enough ENDEND  The few thousand African Union troops who have been placed in Darfur are primarily providing witness to some of the atrocities that are taking place there, but they don't have clear rules of engagement, they are underarmed, undertrained, they don't really provide the sort of protective force that would be needed to not only ensure that existing villages aren't ravaged by the Janjaweeds, but more importantly, that the  million displaced people could actually safely start returning home ENDEND 
Recent reports indicate that in the past few weeks alone, more than , people have been displaced ENDEND  There are also indications that the Janjaweed, recognizing that the AU forces, the African Union forces, are not particularly effective, have started targeting them ENDEND  So there is a sense of deterioration in Darfur, the situation may be getting worse, rather than better ENDEND  And, what's most disturbing is that the United States government seems to be backing off a little bit, the commitment that it made to deal with the problem ENDEND  There was a quote from the undersecretary for African Affairs, Secretary Frasier, in which she indicated that, maybe this was not a genocide after all ENDEND  And, if that ends up being the United State's attitude, then we could see continuing problems of a scale that might eventually reach the same scale in which happened in Rwanda ENDEND 
So, here are a couple of things that we think need to happen ENDEND  Number one: we need a UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur ENDEND  There have been conversations; the UN Secretary General, Koffee Annan, the AU forces, and the Bush Administration have all acknowledged this ENDEND  There's got to be a sense of urgency in which the US diplomatic efforts are focused on getting this UN peacekeeping force up to about , troops, and placing them in Darfur as quickly as possible with a strong protection mandate, rather than a monitoring one ENDEND  In the mean time, it's going to take about year, at best, to get a UN peacekeeping force in place ENDEND  We're going to have to supply and rally, bridging money and forces for the AU throughout this year, because, since it's sort of in lameduck status, the Janjaweed recognize that AU forces are not particularly effective, they may become more and more of a target ENDEND  We're going to have to provide this successor UN force with our own lift and logistic assets ENDEND  We're going to have to provide our military hardware, like transport and attack helicopters, and so forth ENDEND  And, we're going to have to really force other countries like Canada, Australia, some of the European countries that are not engaged in peacekeeping in other places, or at least are not immediately involved in major activity in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, as we are, to deliver the troops that are needed ENDEND 
So, it is absolutely critical that we start focusing on this now ENDEND  The situation, as bad as it is, could deteriorate further ENDEND  This is something that is of interest, I think, to all of us, not just for humanitarian reasons, although when you read the accounts of women being raped when they are out collecting firewood, when you read just horrendous accounts of entire villages being decimated and children being murdered, that it just breaks your heart, and humanitarian concerns should be sufficient, but we also have a strong national security interest ENDEND  If you start seeing more and more failed states, more and more displaced persons, more and more refugees, all of that becomes a breeding ground for terrorist activity, it becomes a breeding ground for disease, and it creates refugees that put pressure on our own borders ENDEND  In an innerconnected world we can't insulate ourselves from these tragedies ENDEND  So, we're going to, over time, have to develop some strategy as the world's remaining superpower to address these issues, and Darfur is an important test case ENDEND  We've already failed one test in Rwanda, we shouldn't fail another ENDEND 
Anyway, if you are interested in the issues related to Darfur, you can always contact my office, or get on the website ENDEND  Your voice is obviously critical in this issue ENDEND  I appreciate you, as always listening in ENDEND  Thank you for downloading, and I will talk to you next week ENDEND  Bye bye ENDEND 

I want to start by thanking the Kaiser foundation for the work you've done not only on today's report, but on making these issues of media and family a part of the national conversation ENDEND 
This is a subject many of us come to not as politicians or policy makers, as but as parents most of all ENDEND 
Because it's one thing to discuss sex and violence on television within the larger context of the culture wars  as a values debate between First Amendment crusaders and those who believe government should decide what we can and cannot watch  but it's a another thing altogether to be faced with these issues while you're sitting in front of the TV with your child ENDEND 
I watch with my daughters, Sasha and Malia, and I can tell you that when we're in the middle of a family program and a commercial for Cialis comes on, it's more than troubling to find yourself wondering how you'll explain certain medical conditions that last longer than three hours to a fouryearold and a sevenyearold ENDEND 
From the time they're young, we try to instill in our children a sense of what's right and wrong; a sense of what's important, of what's worth striving for ENDEND  As best we can, we also try to shield them from the harsher elements of life, and introduce them to the realities of adulthood at the appropriate age ENDEND 
But the concern shared by so many parents today  a concern that frankly hasn't been taken seriously enough by some on the left  is that raising your children this way has become exceedingly difficult in a mass media culture that saturates our airwaves with a steady stream of sex, violence, and materialism ENDEND 
Revolutions in information and technology over the last few decades have caused this stream to grow exponentially, as we're bombarded at every turn with sounds and images from DVDs, iPods, video games, and websites that we can't always control ENDEND 
At the center of it all sits the television, which still consumes the vast majority of our media use  even more so for our children ENDEND  And as we're spending more free time immersed in this media culture, the amount of questionable content spilling across our screens is growing by the year ENDEND 
Still, it's important for us to realize that the real problem we're facing is not simply one of quantity, or even the existence of sex and violence in the media per se ENDEND 
After all, the adult content in Schindler's List is far different from the type on Desperate Housewives, and the violence in Saving Private Ryan is not the same as the kind our kids try to imitate in some of the most popular video games ENDEND 
Rather, as your study today demonstrates, the larger concern here is one of message; it's what the media is teaching our kids about what is ok and what is not; about how to treat others and how to treat themselves ENDEND 
It's a concern that mass media is contributing to an overall coarsening of our culture ENDEND 
That with all the time our children are spending in front of the television, with all the choices they have to see whatever they want whenever they want, the content of their viewing is not enriching their minds, but numbing them; not broadening intellectual curiosity or appreciation for the arts, but trivializing the important and desensitizing us to the tragic ENDEND 
It may seem to some that the effect on our children has been overstated ENDEND  But the studies coming in from the NIH and others show that the connection is real ENDEND  When children are exposed to sex without consequences, they're more likely to have it ENDEND 
When they are shown the risks and responsibilities that go along with sex, at least one major subgroup  AfricanAmerican youth  are more likely to abstain ENDEND  Mindless violence and macho aggression on television begets the same behavior in our kids ENDEND  And when eighty percent of AfricanAmerican teens in a city like Washington think that they'll be rich and over half think they'll be famous, it hurts to hear them say that the path to success lies with the hoop dreams and rap careers glorified on television ENDEND 
We don't teach our children that healthy relationships involve drunken, naked parties in a hot tub with strangers  but that's what they see when they turn on The Real World ENDEND  We don't teach them to express their anger by seeing how much blood they can draw with a round of ammo  but that's what they learn in the most popular video games ENDEND  And we don't teach our kids that the height of success is inheriting a family fortune to buy Gucci bags without ever working a serious day in your life  but that's how Paris Hilton gets by on The Simple Life ENDEND  You can say that kids know this isn't real, but when they're fed a steady diet of these depictions over and over again from the time they're very young, this behavior becomes acceptable  even normal ENDEND 
So what do we do about this? What do we do when bad television becomes the enemy of good parenting?
We start by turning off the TV altogether ENDEND  Our children now spend an average of three hours a day in front of the television  for AfricanAmerican children, it's four hours ENDEND  Two out of every three households have the TV on during meals ENDEND 
This is too much  period ENDEND  And so I think it would help if parents start setting down stricter rules on how much TV their kids watch and limit their hours ENDEND  I know this is difficult ENDEND  At the end of a long day, when Michelle and I are tired, it's easy to just sit the kids in front of the television and relax ENDEND 
But I think that as parents, we have an obligation to our children to turn off the TV, pick up a book, and read to them more often ENDEND 
Beyond that, when our kids do watch television, we should be watching it with them  this means finding programming that everyone can watch as a family and being there to answer any questions it may raise with our kids ENDEND 
Now, at a time when both parents are more likely to work longer hours outside the home, this is a lot easier said than done ENDEND  We try to compete with these media messages, but it's nearly impossible to be there every moment our kids are watching television ENDEND 
And so there's a broader responsibility here ENDEND 
We know that with the pervasiveness of mass media today  the existence of so many means of communication that are so easily accessible all over the world  it's very difficult to regulate our way out of this problem ENDEND  And for those of us who value our First Amendment freedoms  who value artistic expression  we wouldn't want to ENDEND 
But that doesn't mean we have to accept this coarsening of our culture ENDEND 
Decades ago, when television was still in its infancy, we provided broadcasters free use of the public airwaves, which they were to operate as trustees for the public ENDEND  And just last week, the Senate voted to set a final date for the transition to digital television ENDEND 
Today, we need to make it clear that the free use of the public airwaves continues to come with certain specific obligations ENDEND  But we also need to make it clear that for both broadcasters and their competitors there are larger civic obligations to the American public ENDEND  Obligations to reflect not the basest elements of American culture, but the profound and the proud ENDEND 
Obligations to seek not just the quick buck or the bottom line, but healthy discussion and debate in the public square of the information age ENDEND  Obligations to our children; to our families ENDEND 
Today, we have far more choice in what we watch than we could have ever imagined  more channels and more programming ENDEND  As we move further into the digital age, the transformation of entertainment will be even more dramatic than the one from stage to screen ENDEND 
And yet, with all these new choices for consumers, there has been remarkably little done to give parents the tools and the information necessary to make their own informed choices about what their children are watching ENDEND 
This is what the industry must do today ENDEND  As we move towards a digital environment, there is a golden opportunity for them to do it on their own  to use the latest in technology to give parents more information and more choice ENDEND 
For example, this technology could make it possible for parents to create their own family tier just by programming their television to block certain channels, block certain genres of programming like dramas, or block television at certain times of the day ENDEND  There's no reason the industry can't make it as easy to find familyfriendly television as it is to program TiVo ENDEND 
But if the industry fails to act  if it fails to give parents advanced controls and new choices  Congress will ENDEND 
I know that Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye are putting pressure on both broadcasters and cable companies to do a better job fighting indecency, and I'm fully behind their efforts to get the industry to change ENDEND  I also applaud their announcement that they will be convening a summit on these issues with the goal of achieving immediate, meaningful reforms ENDEND 
But I'd like to outline some additional reforms that I think can make a difference for parents today ENDEND 
First, parents should be able to get better information right away  by improving the voluntary rating system we currently have ENDEND  Right now, our television ratings involve nothing more than a tiny box containing some letters and numbers that flashes in the upper lefthand corner of the screen for a few seconds at the beginning of each program ENDEND  It's hard to understand and easy to miss ENDEND  Broadcasters must improve this system to include a fullscreen, detailed rating that gives parents a more precise understanding of exactly what content will be shown in the program ENDEND 
They must also ensure that promos for horror movies and ads for the show Las Vegas aren't being shown in the middle of a cartoon or a family sitcom with a more restrictive rating ENDEND 
Beyond simply blocking out negative messages, however, we also know from Kaiser's studies that television has the power to promote positive messages that can influence behavior and raise awareness ENDEND 
Public service announcements have actually led to reductions in teen pregnancy, and we should all be proud of the media initiative undertaken by the Kaiser Foundation with Viacom, BET, UPN and other networks to eradicate ignorance about HIV and AIDS ENDEND 
There has been a long debate about what obligations broadcasters will have to the public in this new digital age ENDEND  The FCC took a first step in defining these obligations by requiring that broadcasters air children's educational programming on all their digital streams ENDEND 
As they continue this process, the FCC must make sure they spell out these obligations before the transition to digital programming is complete ENDEND 
When they do this, they need to make sure that broadcasters have a concrete obligation to provide public service announcements at times when people can actually see them, as well as better coverage of elections ENDEND  They should donate the public service time to a thirdparty like the Ad Council that works with reputable nonprofits ENDEND  If they do not do this, Congress should ENDEND 
In addition, we should also fight to prevent any attempt to gut funding or support for the Public Broadcasting System  positive television with educational messages that generations of children have been raised on ENDEND 
Finally, there's current legislation out there that would promote further studies  like this one  which would study the effects of media on the health and development of our children ENDEND  This will provide parents with even more information, it's got bipartisan support in Congress, and I think it's a good idea to pursue ENDEND 
In Newton Minow's famous "Vast Wasteland" speech to the National Association of Television Broadcasters, he told them that,
"It is not enough to cater to the nation's whims  you must also serve the nation's needs ENDEND "
Four decades later, we find ourselves immersed in a mass media culture that is at once more vast and more wasteful than ever before ENDEND  And so once again, we find ourselves asking those in charge to serve the needs of a nation that has a higher calling than simply peddling indecency and materialism for profit ENDEND  We don't have to accept what we see today as inevitable ENDEND  We can all work together to make media a place where big ideas and great debates are communicated ENDEND  We owe this much to ourselves, and we certainly owe it to our children ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

Good morning ENDEND  I want to start by thanking American University and the Committee for Economic Development for hosting this panel today ENDEND  It's an honor to be here and an honor to be among such great company ENDEND 
Over one hundred years ago, at the dawn of the last century, the Industrial Revolution was beginning to take hold of America, creating unimaginable wealth in sprawling metropolises all across the country ENDEND 
As factories multiplied and profits grew, the winnings of the new economy became more and more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons, railroad tycoons and oil magnates ENDEND  In the cities, power was maintained by a corrupt system of political machines and ward bosses ENDEND  And in the state of New York, there existed a young governor who was determined to give government back to the people ENDEND 
In just his first year, he had already begun to antagonize the state's political machine by attacking its system of favors and corporate giveaways ENDEND  He also signed a workers' compensation bill, and even fired the superintendent of insurance for taking money from the very industry he was supposed to be regulating ENDEND 
None of this sat too well with New York's powerful party boss, who finally plotted to get rid of the reformminded governor by making sure he was nominated for the Vice Presidency that year ENDEND 
What no one could have expected is that soon after the election, when President William McKinley was assassinated, the greatest fears of the corrupt machine bosses and powerbrokers came true when that former governor became President of the United States and went on to bust trusts, break up monopolies, and return the government to its people ENDEND 
His name, of course, was Theodore Roosevelt ENDEND  He was a Republican ENDEND  And throughout his public life, he demonstrated a willingness to put party and politics aside in order to battle corruption and give people an open, honest government that would fight for their interests and uphold their values ENDEND 
Today, we face a similar crisis of corruption ENDEND  And I believe that we deserve similar leadership from those in power as well ENDEND 
The American people are tired of a Washington that's only open to those with the most cash and the right connections ENDEND  They're tired of a political process where the vote you cast isn't as important as the favors you can do ENDEND  And they're tired of trusting us with their tax dollars when they see them spent on frivolous pet projects and corporate giveaways ENDEND 
It's not that the games that are played in this town are new or surprising to the public ENDEND  People are not naive to the existence of corruption and they know it has worn the face of both Republicans and Democrats over the years ENDEND 
Moreover, the underlying issue of how extensively money influences politics is the original sin of everyone who's ever run for office  myself included ENDEND  In order to get elected, we need to raise vast sums of money by meeting and dealing with people who are disproportionately wealthy ENDEND  This is a problem that predates George Bush or Jack Abramoff, and I believe that a serious, bipartisan conversation about campaign finance reform is one that this town would do well to have in the months to come ENDEND 
Yet, while people are familiar with these problems and they encompass both parties, I do think it's fair to say that the scandals we've seen under the current White House and Congress  both legal and illegal  are far worse than most of us could have imagined ENDEND 
Think about it ENDEND  In the past several months, we've seen politicians resigning for taking millions of dollars in bribes ENDEND  We've seen the head of the White House procurement office arrested ENDEND  We've seen some of our most powerful leaders of both the House and the Senate under federal investigation ENDEND  We've seen the number of registered lobbyists in Washington double since George Bush came into office ENDEND  And of course, we've seen the indictment of Jack Abramoff and his cronies ENDEND 
Now, there's an argument made that somehow this is a bipartisan scandal ENDEND  And the defense here is that everybody does it ENDEND  Well, not everybody does it ENDEND  And people shouldn't lump together those of us who have to raise funds to run campaigns but do so in a legal and ethical way with those who invite lobbyists in to write bad legislation ENDEND  Those aren't equivalent, and we're not being partisan by pointing that out ENDEND 
The fact is, since this Republican leadership has come to power, this kind of scandal has been the regular order of business in this town ENDEND  For years now, they have openly bragged about stocking K Street lobbying firms with former leadership staffers to increase their power in Washington ENDEND 
And yet, what is truly offensive to the American people about all of this goes far beyond people like Jack Abramoff ENDEND  It's bigger than how much time he'll spend in jail or how many Republicans he'll turn in ENDEND  Bigger than the K Street project and golf junkets to Scotland and lavish gifts for lawmakers ENDEND 
What's truly offensive about these scandals is that they don't just lead to morally offensive conduct on the part of politicians; they lead to morally offensive legislation that hurts hardworking Americans ENDEND 
Because when big oil companies are invited into the White House for secret energy meetings, it's no wonder they end up with billions in tax breaks while Americans still struggle to fill up their gas tanks and heat their homes ENDEND 
When a Committee Chairman negotiates a Medicare bill at the same time he's negotiating for a job as the drug industry's lobbyist, it's hardly a surprise when that industry gets taxpayerfunded giveaways in the same bill that forbids seniors from bargaining for better drug prices ENDEND 
When the people running Washington are accountable only to the special interests that fund their campaigns, of course they'll spend your tax dollars with reckless abandon; of course they'll load up bills with pet projects and drive us into deficit with the hope that no one will notice ENDEND 
In , over  ENDEND  billion was spent lobbying Congress ENDEND  That amounts to over  ENDEND  million per Member of Congress ENDEND   ENDEND  million per member so that oil companies can still run our energy policy and pharmaceutical companies can still raise our drug prices and special interests can still waste our tax dollars on pet projects ENDEND 
How much do you think the American people were able to spend on their Senator or Representative last year? How much money could the folks who can't fill up their gas tanks spend? How much could the seniors forced to choose between their medications and their groceries spend?
Not  ENDEND  million ENDEND  Not even close ENDEND 
This is the bigger story here, and this is why the recent scandals have shaken the American people's faith in a government that will look out for their interests and uphold their values ENDEND 
The wellconnected CEOs and hired guns on K Street who've helped write our laws have gotten what they paid for ENDEND  They got all the tax breaks and loopholes and access they could ever want ENDEND  But outside this city, the people who can't afford the highpriced lobbyists and don't want to break the law are wondering, "When is it our turn? When will someone in Washington stand up for me?"
We need to answer that call because let's face it  for the last few years, the people running Washington simply haven't ENDEND  And while only some are to blame for the corruption that has plagued this city, all are responsible for fixing it ENDEND 
Now, I've been asked by my caucus to take a role in lobbying reform  a role I'm proud to have ENDEND  As many of you know I'm from Chicago  a city that hasn't always had the cleanest reputation when it comes to politics in this country ENDEND  But during my first year in the Illinois State Senate, I helped lead the fight to pass Illinois' first ethics reform bill in twentyfive years ENDEND  I hope we can do something like that here ENDEND 
I realize there are many proposals floating around out there, and I also realize that our friends on the other side of the aisle have many of their own ENDEND  I think that's commendable ENDEND  In fact, I look forward to working in a bipartisan fashion to get a solid bill passed ENDEND 
But this has to be a serious bill, and it has to go a long way toward correcting some of the most egregious offenses of the last few years ENDEND  This is not a time for windowdressing or putting a bandaid on a problem just to score political points ENDEND  This is a time for real reform, and I think the Democrats' Honest Leadership and Open Government Act does this by including provisions that so far the Republican proposals do not ENDEND 
Real reform means making sure that Members of Congress and the Administration tell us when they're negotiating for jobs with industries they're responsible for regulating ENDEND  That way we don't have people writing a drug bill during the day and meeting with pharmaceutical companies about their future salary at night ENDEND 
Real reform means giving the public access to nowsecret conference committee meetings and posting all bills on the Internet  hours before they're voted on, so the public can scrutinize what's in them ENDEND 
Real reform means passing a bill that eliminates all gifts and meals from lobbyists, not just the expensive ones ENDEND  If the we truly agree that having a lobbyist constantly pick up the tab for lunch can help influence legislation, then they'll have no problem changing their position so that the ban includes meals of any price ENDEND 
Real reform means ending the nobid contracts for wellconnected contributors that have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in both Iraq and the Gulf Coast ENDEND  And it means ending the practice of appointing your political buddies to positions they are wholly unqualified for ENDEND  It means no more Brownies ENDEND 
Finally, I think that real reform must include real oversight and accountability ENDEND  Our bill sets up an independent Office of Public Integrity to keep an eye on lobbyists and to make sure they comply with the rules ENDEND 
Now, personally, I think that there's an opportunity for us to go even further than some of the proposals that have come from both parties ENDEND  And that's why last week I introduced the CLEAN UP Act, which would build on the Democrats' reform bill by giving the American public a clearer view of what's going on here in Washington ENDEND 
See, one of the reasons why lobbyists like Abramoff and their allies in Congress have been able to manipulate the system is because most of their backroom deals are done in secret ENDEND  Just the other day, we heard that because of pressure from health care industry lobbyists, Republican negotiators met behind closed doors and changed a budget bill to provide a  billion giveaway to HMOs   billion that would come right out of the pockets of American taxpayers ENDEND  But of course, no one knew about the change until much later, and no lawmaker would admit to making it ENDEND 
This is an outrage, and my bill would change this by identifying secret provisions like these that weren't in the original bill, and it would let the public know who put them there, so that special interest giveaways couldn't be slipped in at the last minute ENDEND  My bill also would shine the spotlight on those pet projects that lawmakers sneak into every spending bill by requiring that they earmarks be posted on the internet  hours before they're voted on ENDEND  The watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, recently endorsed this bill, and I hope that the Senate will take it up soon ENDEND 
Let me close with one final point ENDEND  Even if we pass a good bill and rid Washington of the Jack Abramoffs of the world, it's going to take much more than gift bans and lobbying reform to restore the public's faith in a government ENDEND  It will take not simply a change in laws, but a change in attitudes ENDEND 
To do this  to earn back that trust  to show people that we're working for them and looking out for their interests  we have to start acting like it ENDEND 
That means instead of meeting with lobbyists, it's time to start meeting with some of the  million Americans with no health care ENDEND 
Instead of finding cushy political jobs for unqualified buddies, it's time to start finding goodpaying jobs for hardworking Americans trying to raise a family ENDEND 
Instead of hitting up the big firms on K Street, it's time to start visiting the workers on Main Street who wonder how they'll send their kids to college or whether their pension will be around when they retire ENDEND 
All these people have done to earn access and gain influence is cast their ballot ENDEND  But in this democracy, it's all anyone should have to do ENDEND 
A century ago, that young, reformminded governor of New York who later became our twentysixth President gave us words about our country everyone in this town would do well to listen to today ENDEND  Teddy Roosevelt said that,
"No republic can permanently endure when its politics are corrupt and base ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND we can afford to differ on the currency, the tariff, and foreign policy, but we cannot afford to differ on the question of honesty ENDEND  There is a soul in the community, a soul in the nation, just exactly as their is a soul in the individual; and exactly as the individual hopelessly mars himself if he lets his conscience be dulled by the constant repetition of unworthy acts, so the nation will hopelessly blunt the popular conscience if it permits its public men continually to do acts which the nation in its heart of hearts knows are acts which cast discredit upon our whole public life ENDEND "
I can only hope that in the weeks to come, the work we do here and in Congress will once again strengthen this nation's soul and bring credit back to our public life ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

I want to thank the many people inside and outside of Congress who worked so hard over the past year to get us here ENDEND  We owe a debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle, and we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter, Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy, and Rep ENDEND  Mel Watt ENDEND  Without their work and dedication  and the support of voting rights advocates around the country  I doubt this bill would have come before us so soon ENDEND 
And I want to thank both chambers, and both sides of the aisle, for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original Act  years ago ENDEND  At a time when Americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work, the refreshing display of bipartisanship we are seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the Act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together ENDEND 
Nobody can deny that we've come a long way since  ENDEND 
Look at registration numbers ENDEND  Only two years after passage of the original Act, registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled ENDEND  Soon after, not a single state covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less than half of its minority votingage population ENDEND 
Look at the influence of AfricanAmerican elected officials at all levels of government ENDEND  There are AfricanAmerican members of Congress ENDEND  Since , our nation's top diplomat has been an AfricanAmerican ENDEND 
In fact, most of America's elected AfricanAmerican officials come from the states covered by Section  of the Voting Rights Act  states like Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Georgia ENDEND 
But to me, the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building, in my dear friend, Congressman John Lewis, who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement, risking life and limb for freedom ENDEND  And on March , , he led  peaceful protestors demanding the right to vote across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama ENDEND 
I've often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day ENDEND  Not only John Lewis and Hosea Williams leading the march, but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it ENDEND  Blacks and whites, teenagers and children, teachers and bankers and shopkeepers  a beloved community of God's children ready to stand for freedom ENDEND 
And I wonder, where did they find that kind of courage? When you're facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gas ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND when they're coming toward you spewing hatred and violence, how do you simply stop, kneel down, and pray to the Lord for salvation?
But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day  after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life, after people's heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their children's innocence literally beaten out of them ENDEND  ENDEND  ENDEND after all that, they went back to march again ENDEND 
They marched again ENDEND  They crossed the bridge ENDEND  They awakened a nation's conscience, and not five months later, the Voting Rights Act of  was signed into law ENDEND  And it was reauthorized in , , and  ENDEND 
Now, in , John Lewis, the physical scars from those marches still visible, is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and he was joined last week by  of his House colleagues in voting for its passage ENDEND 
There are some who argue the Act is no longer needed, that the protections of Section 's "preclearance" requirement  a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote  are targeting the wrong states ENDEND  But the evidence refutes that notion ENDEND  Of the , objections issued by the Department of Justice since ,  occurred since the last reauthorization in  ENDEND  So, despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote, it's clear that problems still exist ENDEND 
Others have argued against renewing Section 's protection of language minorities ENDEND  Unfortunately, these arguments have been tied to the debate over immigration and muddle a noncontroversial issue  protecting the right to vote  with one of today's most contentious debates ENDEND 
But let's remember: you can't request language assistance if you're not a voter, and you can't be a voter if you're not a citizen ENDEND  And while voters, as citizens, must be proficient in English, many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors ENDEND 
A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying: "Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process; they also feel they trust the process more when they understand it ENDEND " These sentiments  connection to and trust in our democratic process  are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation ENDEND 
Our challenges don't end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act either ENDEND  We have to prevent the problems we've seen in recent elections from happening again ENDEND  We've seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason, prevent eligible exfelons from casting ballots, distribute polling equipment unevenly, and deceive voters about the time, location and rules of elections ENDEND  Unfortunately, these efforts have been directed primarily at minorities, the disabled, lowincome individuals, and other historically disenfranchised groups ENDEND 
The Help America Vote Act was a big step in the right direction, but we need to do more ENDEND  We need to fully fund HAVA ENDEND  We need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases ENDEND  We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and that the equipment works ENDEND  And we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day ENDEND 
We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of deplorable intimidation tactics when they do get to the polls ENDEND  In , Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement ENDEND  These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps, and followed voters to their cars to record their license plate numbers ENDEND 
In Lake County, Ohio, some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that they could not vote ENDEND 
In Wisconsin, a flier purporting to be from the "Milwaukee Black Voters League" was circulated in predominantly AfricanAmerican neighborhoods with the following message: "If you've already voted in any election this year, you can't vote in the presidential election ENDEND  If you violate any of these laws, you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you ENDEND "
So, we have much more work to do ENDEND  This occasion is cause for celebration, but it's also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights ENDEND  As Congressman Lewis said last week: "It's clear that we have come a great distance, but we still have a great distance to go ENDEND "
The memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights Act ENDEND  Since that day, the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote, but the right to have their vote counted ENDEND  Those of us concerned about protecting those rights can't afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill ENDEND  We must take advantage of this rare united front and continue the fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls for all Americans ENDEND  In other words, we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge, and we have to spread it across this country ENDEND 
Two weeks after the first march was turned back, Dr ENDEND  King told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members that they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice ENDEND  That's because of the work that each of us do to bend it towards justice ENDEND  It's because of people like John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks, all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand that we are the beneficiaries of that arc bending towards justice ENDEND 
That's why I stand here today ENDEND  I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice ENDEND  I hope we continue to see that spirit live on, not just during this debate, but throughout all our work here in the Senate ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 

I want to start by saying how blessed I feel to be a part of today and how grateful I am for your church and your pastor, my friend Rick Warren ENDEND 
Ever since Rick and Kay visited Africa to see the pain and suffering wrought by AIDS, the Warrens and this church have proved each day that faith is not just something you have, it's something you do ENDEND  Their decision to devote their time, their money, and their purposedriven lives to the greatest health crisis in human history is not one that's always reported on the news or splashed across the front pages, but it is quietly becoming one of the most influential forces in the struggle against HIV and AIDS ENDEND  The resources of governments may be vast, and the good works of philanthropists may be abundant, but we should never underestimate how powerful the passion of people of faith can be in eradicating this disease ENDEND 
One of those passionate individuals is the man we just heard from  my friend and colleague, Sam Brownback ENDEND  Now, Sam and I may not agree on every issue, but I could not be more impressed with his efforts on issues like AIDS, the crisis in the Congo, the genocide in Darfur and sexual trafficking  issues that touch some of the world's most vulnerable people ENDEND  I am proud to work with him on many of these issues, and I'm proud to be by his side today ENDEND 
I took my own trip to Africa a few months ago ENDEND  As I'm sure Rick and Kay would agree, it's an experience that stays with you for quite some time ENDEND  I visited an HIVAIDS hospital in South Africa that was filled to capacity with people who walked hours  even days  just for the chance to seek help ENDEND  I met courageous patients who refused to give up for themselves or their families ENDEND  And I came across AIDS activists who meet resistance from their own government but keep on fighting anyway ENDEND 
But of all that I heard, I encountered few stories as heartbreaking as the one recently told by Laurie Goering, a Chicago Tribune reporter based in Johannesburg who had covered our trip for her newspaper ENDEND 
Three years ago, Laurie hired a woman named Hlengiwe Leocardia Mchunu as her nanny ENDEND  Leo, as she is known, grew up as one of nine children in a small South African village ENDEND  All through her life, she worked hard to raise her two kids and save every last penny she earned, and by the time Leo was hired as Laurie's nanny, she had almost finished paying off the mortgage on her home ENDEND  She had even hoped to use the extra money from her new job to open a refuge for local children who had been orphaned by AIDS ENDEND 
Then one day, Leo received a phone call that her eldest brother had fallen ill ENDEND  At first he told everyone it was diabetes, but later, in the hospital, admitted to the family it was AIDS ENDEND  He died a few days later ENDEND  His wife succumbed to the disease as well ENDEND  And Leo took in their three children ENDEND 
Six months later, Leo got another phone call ENDEND  Her younger brother had also become sick with AIDS ENDEND  She cared for him and nursed him as she did her first brother, but he soon died as well ENDEND 
Leo's pregnant sister was next ENDEND  And then another brother ENDEND  And then another brother ENDEND 
She paid for their caskets and their funerals ENDEND  She took in their children and paid for their schooling ENDEND  She ran out of money, and she borrowed what she could ENDEND  She ran out again, and she borrowed even more ENDEND 
And still, the phone calls continued ENDEND  All across her tiny village, Leo watched more siblings and cousins and nieces and nephews test positive for HIV ENDEND  She saw neighbors lose their families ENDEND  She saw a grandmother house sixteen orphaned grandchildren under her roof ENDEND  And she saw some children go hungry because there was no one to care for them at all ENDEND 
You know, AIDS is a story often told by numbers ENDEND   million infected with HIV ENDEND  Nearly  ENDEND  million this year alone ENDEND   million orphans in Africa ENDEND  , deaths and , new infections every single day ENDEND  In some places,  of those with HIV do not know they have it ENDEND  And we just learned that AIDS is set to become the rd leading cause of death worldwide in the coming years ENDEND 
They are staggering, these numbers, and they help us understand the magnitude of this pandemic ENDEND  But when repeated by themselves, statistics can also numb  they can hide the individual stories and tragedies and hopes of the Leos who live the daily drama of this disease ENDEND 
On this World AIDS day, these are the stories that the world needs to hear ENDEND  They are the stories that touch our souls  and that call us to action ENDEND 
I cannot begin to imagine what it would be like if Leo's family was my own ENDEND  If I had to answer those phone calls  if I had to attend those funerals ENDEND  All I know is that no matter how or why my family became sick, I would be called to care for them and comfort them and do what I could to help find a cure ENDEND  I know every one of you would do the same if it were your family ENDEND 
Here's the thing  my faith tells me that Leo's family is my family ENDEND 
We are all sick because of AIDS  and we are all tested by this crisis ENDEND  It is a test not only of our willingness to respond, but of our ability to look past the artificial divisions and debates that have often shaped that response ENDEND  When you go to places like Africa and you see this problem up close, you realize that it's not a question of either treatment or prevention  or even what kind of prevention  it is all of the above ENDEND  It is not an issue of either science or values  it is both ENDEND  Yes, there must be more money spent on this disease ENDEND  But there must also be a change in hearts and minds; in cultures and attitudes ENDEND  Neither philanthropist nor scientist; neither government nor church, can solve this problem on their own  AIDS must be an allhandsondeck effort ENDEND 
Let's talk about what these efforts involve ENDEND  First, if we hope to win this fight, we must stop new infections  we must do what we can to prevent people from contracting HIV in the first place ENDEND 
Now, too often, the issue of prevention has been framed in eitheror terms ENDEND  For some, the only way to prevent the disease is for men and women to change their sexual behavior  in particular, to abstain from sexual activity outside of marriage ENDEND  For others, such a prescription is unrealistic; they argue that we need to provide people with the tools they need to protect themselves from the virus, regardless of their sexual practices  in particular, by increasing the use of condoms, as well as by developing new methods, like microbicides, that women can initiate themselves to prevent transmission during sex ENDEND  And in the debate surrounding how we should tackle the scourge of AIDS, we often see each side questioning the other's motives, and thereby impeding progress ENDEND 
For me, this is a false argument ENDEND  Let me say this  I don't think we can deny that there is a moral and spiritual component to prevention  that in too many places all over the world where AIDS is prevalent  including our own country, by the way  the relationship between men and women, between sexuality and spirituality, has broken down, and needs to be repaired ENDEND 
It was striking to see this as I traveled through South Africa and Kenya ENDEND  Again and again, I heard stories of men and women contracting HIV because sex was no longer part of a sacred covenant, but a mechanical physical act; because men had visited prostitutes and brought the disease home to their wives, or young girls had been subjected to rape and abuse ENDEND 
These are issues of prevention we cannot walk away from ENDEND  When a husband thinks it's acceptable to hide his infidelity from his wife, it's not only a sin, it's a potential death sentence ENDEND  And when rape is still seen as a woman's fault and a woman's shame, but promiscuity is a man's prerogative, it is a problem of the heart that no government can solve ENDEND  It is, however, a place where local ministries and churches like Saddleback can, and have, made a real difference  by providing people with a moral framework to make better choices ENDEND 
Having said that, I also believe that we cannot ignore that abstinence and fidelity may too often be the ideal and not the reality  that we are dealing with flesh and blood men and women and not abstractions  and that if condoms and potentially microbicides can prevent millions of deaths, they should be made more widely available ENDEND  I know that there are those who, out of sincere religious conviction, oppose such measures ENDEND  And with these folks, I must respectfully but unequivocally disagree ENDEND  I do not accept the notion that those who make mistakes in their lives should be given an effective death sentence ENDEND  Nor am I willing to stand by and allow those who are entirely innocent  wives who, because of the culture they live in, often have no power to refuse sex with their husbands, or children who are born with the infection as a consequence of their parent's behavior suffer when condoms or other measures would have kept them from harm ENDEND 
Another area where we can make significant progress in prevention is by removing the stigma that goes along with getting tested for HIVAIDS ENDEND  The idea that in some places, nine in ten people with HIV have no idea they're infected is more than frightening  it's a ticking time bomb waiting to go off ENDEND 
So we need to show people that just as there is no shame in going to the doctor for a blood test or a CAT scan or a mammogram, there is no shame in going for an HIV test ENDEND  Because while there was once a time when a positive result gave little hope, today the earlier you know, the faster you can get help ENDEND  My wife Michelle and I were able to take the test on our trip to Africa, after the Center for Disease Control informed us that by getting a simple  minute test, we may have encouraged as many as halfamillion Kenyans to get tested as well ENDEND  Rick Warren has also taken the test ENDEND  Sam Brownback and I took it today ENDEND  And I encourage others in public life to do the same ENDEND  We've got to spread the word to as many people as possible ENDEND  It's time for us to set an example for others to follow ENDEND 
Of course, even as we work diligently to slow the rate of new infection, we also have a responsibility to treat the  million people who are already living with HIV ENDEND 
In some ways, this should be the easy part ENDEND  Because we know what works ENDEND  We know how to save people's lives ENDEND  We know the medicine is out there and we know that wealthy countries can afford to do more ENDEND 
That's why it was so frustrating for me to go to South Africa, and see the pain, and see the suffering, and then hear that the country's Minister of Health had promoted the use of beet root, sweet potato, and lemon juice as the best way to cure HIV ENDEND  Thankfully, the South African government eventually repudiated this, but it's impossible to overestimate how important it is for political leaders like this to set a good example for their people ENDEND 
We should never forget that God granted us the power to reason so that we would do His work here on Earth  so that we would use science to cure disease, and heal the sick, and save lives ENDEND  And one of the miracles to come out of the AIDS pandemic is that scientists have discovered medicine that can give people with HIV a new chance at life ENDEND 
We are called to give them that chance ENDEND  We have made progress  in South Africa, treatment provided to pregnant women has drastically reduced the incidents of infants born with the infection ENDEND  But despite such progress, only one in every five people with HIV around the world is receiving antiretroviral drug treatment ENDEND  One in every five ENDEND  We must do better ENDEND  We should work with drug companies to reduce the costs of generic antiretroviral drugs, and work with developing nations to help them build the health infrastructure that's necessary to get sick people treated  this means more money for hospitals and medical equipment, and more training for nurses and doctors ENDEND 
We need a renewed emphasis on nutrition ENDEND  Right now we're finding out that there are people who are on the drugs, who are getting treatment, who are still dying because they don't have any food to eat ENDEND  This is inexcusable  especially in countries that have sufficient food supplies ENDEND  So we must help get them that nutrition, and this is another place where religious organizations that have always provided food to the hungry can help a great deal ENDEND 
And even as we focus on the enormous crisis in Africa, we need to remember that the problem is not in Africa alone ENDEND  In the last few years, we have seen an alarming rise in infection rates in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean ENDEND  And on this World AIDS day, we cannot forget the crisis occurring in our own backyard ENDEND  Right here in the United States, AIDS is now the leading cause of death for African American women aged , and we are also seeing many poorer and rural communities fail to get the resources they need to deal with their vulnerable populations  a problem that unfortunately some in Congress are trying to address by taking money away from larger cities that are still facing enormous problems of their own ENDEND 
Now let me say this  I think that President Bush and this past Congress should be applauded for the resources they have contributed to the fight against HIV and AIDS ENDEND  Through our country's emergency plan for AIDS relief, the United States will have contributed more than  billion over five years to combat HIVAIDS overseas ENDEND  And the Global Fund, with money from the United States and other countries, has done some heroic work to fight this disease ENDEND  As I traveled throughout Africa this summer, I was proud of the tangible impact that all this money was having, often through coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control, the State Department, foreign governments, and nongovernmental organizations ENDEND 
So our first priority in Congress should be to reauthorize this program when it expires in  ENDEND  Our second priority should be to reassess what's worked and what hasn't so that we're not wasting one dollar that could be saving someone's life ENDEND 
But our third priority should be to actually boost our contribution to this effort ENDEND  With all that is left to be done in this struggle  with all the other areas of the world that need our help  it's time for us to add at least an additional  billion a year in new money over the next five years to strengthen and expand the program to places like Southeast Asia, India, and Eastern Europe, where the pandemic will soon reach crisis proportions ENDEND 
Of course, given all the strains that have been placed on the United States   budget, and given the extraordinary needs that we face here at home, it may be hard to find the money ENDEND  But I believe we must try ENDEND  I believe it will prove to be a wise investment ENDEND  The list of reasons for us to care about AIDS is long ENDEND  In an interconnected, globalized world, the ability of pandemics to spread to other countries and continents has never been easier or faster than it is today ENDEND  There are also security implications, as countries whose populations and economies have been ravaged by AIDS become fertile breeding grounds for civil strife and even terror ENDEND 
But the reason for us to step up our efforts can't simply be instrumental ENDEND  There are more fundamental reasons to care ENDEND  Reasons related to our own humanity ENDEND  Reasons of the soul ENDEND 
Like no other illness, AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes  to empathize with the plight of our fellow man ENDEND  While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracted the disease through no fault of their own, it has too often been easy for some to point to the unfaithful husband or the promiscuous youth or the gay man and say "This is your fault ENDEND  You have sinned ENDEND "
I don't think that's a satisfactory response ENDEND  My faith reminds me that we all are sinners ENDEND 
My faith also tells me that  as Pastor Rick has said  it is not a sin to be sick ENDEND  My Bible tells me that when God sent his only Son to Earth, it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary; to feed the hungry and clothe the naked; to befriend the outcast and redeem those who strayed from righteousness ENDEND 
Living His example is the hardest kind of faith  but it is surely the most rewarding ENDEND  It is a way of life that can not only light our way as people of faith, but guide us to a new and better politics as Americans ENDEND 
For in the end, we must realize that the AIDS orphan in Africa presents us with the same challenge as the gang member in South Central, or the Katrina victim in New Orleans, or the uninsured mother in North Dakota ENDEND 
We can turn away from these Americans, and blame their problems on themselves, and embrace a politics that's punitive and petty, divisive and small ENDEND 
Or we can embrace another tradition of politics  a tradition that has stretched from the days of our founding to the glory of the civil rights movement, a tradition based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another  and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart, and that if enough people believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it, then we might not solve every problem, but we can get something meaningful done for the people with whom we share this Earth ENDEND 
Let me close by returning to the story of Leo, that South African woman burdened by so much death and despair ENDEND  Sometime after the death of her fifth sibling, she decided that she wasn't just going to stand idly by ENDEND  She decided to call the town's first public meeting about the AIDS crisis  something that no one had even talked about, let alone met about ENDEND   people showed up ENDEND  Some had walked for miles to get there, a few with their grandchildren on their back ENDEND 
One by one, they stood up and broke their silence, and they told their stories ENDEND  Stories of tragedy, and stories of hope ENDEND  And when they were done, Leo rose and said, "I don't know whether we will win this war, but I'm looking for people who will stand up and face the reality ENDEND  The time for sitting silently has come to an end ENDEND "
Everything did not suddenly get better after that meeting, but some things did ENDEND  Despite all the children she had to raise and all the sick relatives she still had to care for, Leo still decided to open the AIDS orphanage she had dreamed about so long ago ENDEND  She began building a daycare center that would house one hundred orphans ENDEND  And she started plans on a youth center and a soup kitchen ENDEND 
I hear that part of the story and I think, if this woman who has so little, and has lost so much, can do so much good  if she can still make a way out of no way  then what are we waiting for?
Corinthians says that we are all of one spirit, and that "if one part suffers, every part suffers with it ENDEND " But it also says, "if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it ENDEND "
On this World AIDS day, it is the stories of overcoming, and not just illness, that the world needs to hear ENDEND  Yes, the stories of sadness call us to suffer with the sick ENDEND  But stories like Leo's also call us to honor her example, rejoice in the hope that it brings, and work to help her find that brighter future ENDEND  Thank you, and God Bless you ENDEND 

When Ryan was just two years old, his parents and doctors noted severe delays in his motor and speech development, and he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy ENDEND  His parents were devastated, as the prognosis for many children with cerebral palsy is quite grim, and given the severity of Ryan's condition, his doctors didn't have much hope for his improvement ENDEND 
Yet, his parents had hope ENDEND  Because when Ryan was born, his parents had saved his cord blood, a viable but limited source of stem cells ENDEND  They found a doctor at Duke University who was willing to perform an experimental infusion with these cells to see if they might improve his condition ENDEND 
They did ENDEND  In fact, they seem to have cured him ENDEND 
Within months of the infusion, Ryan was able to speak, use his arms, and eat normally, just like any other child  a miracle his family had once only dreamed of ENDEND 
Ryan's story exemplifies the power and the promise of stem cells to treat and cure the millions of Americans who are suffering from catastrophic, debilitating and lifethreatening diseases and health conditions ENDEND 
Each year, , Americans will develop Alzheimer's disease ENDEND  Over  million adults will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, which can lead to complications such as blindness, damaged nerves and loss of kidney function ENDEND  And there are far too many individuals with spinal cord injuries who are struggling to maintain mobility and independence ENDEND 
For most of our history, medicine has offered little hope of recovery to individuals affected by these and other devastating illnesses and injuries ENDEND 
Until now ENDEND 
Recent developments in stem cell research may hold the key to improved treatments, if not cures, for those affected by Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury and countless other conditions ENDEND 
Many men, women and children who are cancer survivors are already familiar with the lifesaving applications of adult stem cell research ENDEND  Patients with leukemia or lymphoma often undergo bone marrow transplants, a type of stem cell transplant, which can significantly prolong life, or permanently get rid of the cancer ENDEND  This therapy has been used successfully for decades, and is saving lives everyday ENDEND 
Yet this breakthrough has its serious limitations ENDEND  Adult stem cells, such as those used in bone marrow transplants, can only be collected in small quantities, may not be a match for the patient, and have limited ability to transform into specialized cells ENDEND 
Cord blood, like the kind Ryan used, has limitations as well ENDEND  If, for example, young Ryan's condition should deteriorate or he should develop another illness, there simply are not enough cord blood cells left for a second use ENDEND  His mother has told us that the few remaining cells would have to be cloned to get enough cells for future use, or they would have to obtain stem cells from another source ENDEND 
These and other difficulties are the reasons why scientists have started to explore other types and other sources for stem cells, including embryonic stem cell research ENDEND 
Embryonic stem cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including in vitro fertilization ENDEND  At this very moment, there are over , embryos being stored in over  facilities throughout the United States ENDEND  The majority of these are reserved for infertile couples ENDEND  However, many of these embryos will go unused, destined for permanent storage in a freezer or disposal ENDEND  We should expand and accelerate research using these embryos, just as we should continue to explore the viability of adult stem cell use and cord blood use ENDEND 
All over the country, exciting progress is being made in the area of embryonic stem cell research ENDEND  At the University of Illinois, they're finding that stem cells have the potential to treat blood disorders, lung diseases, and heart damage ENDEND 
At Johns Hopkins, researchers were able to use mouse embryonic stem cells to repair damaged nerves and restore mobility in paralyzed rats ENDEND  One can't help but think that it's a matter of when, not if, this research will be able to one day help those who have lost the ability to walk ENDEND 
For these reasons, I'm proud to be a longterm supporter of greater stem cell research ENDEND  While I was a member of the Illinois Senate, I was the chief cosponsor of the Ronald Reagan Biomedical Research Act, which would specifically permit embryonic stem cell research in Illinois, and establish review of this research by the Illinois Department of Public Health ENDEND 
And I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the stem cell bill before us today ENDEND  This bill embodies the innovative thinking that we as a society demand and medical advancement requires ENDEND  By expanding scientific access to embryonic stem cells which would be otherwise discarded, this bill will help our nation's scientists and researchers develop treatments and cures to help people who suffer from illnesses and injuries for which there are currently none ENDEND  But the bill is not without limits; it requires that scientific research also be subject to rigorous oversight ENDEND 
I realize there are moral and ethical issues surrounding this debate ENDEND  But I also realize that we're not talking about harvesting cells that would've been used to create life and we're not talking about cloning humans ENDEND  We're talking about using stem cells that would have otherwise been discarded and lost forever  and we're talking about using those stem cells to possibly save the lives of millions of Americans ENDEND 
Democrats want this bill to pass ENDEND  Conservative, prolife Republicans want this bill to pass ENDEND  By large margins, the American people want this bill to pass ENDEND  It is only the White House standing in the way of progress  standing in the way of so many potential cures ENDEND 
I would only ask that the President thinks about this before he picks up his pen to deliver his first veto in six years ENDEND  I would ask that he thinks about Ryan Schneider and his parents, and all the other families who are sitting and waiting and praying for a cure  hoping that somewhere, a researcher or scientist will find the answer ENDEND 
There was a time in the middle of the last century when America watched helplessly as a mysterious disease left thousands  especially children  disabled for life ENDEND  The medical community worked tirelessly to try and find a cure, but they needed help  they needed funding to make their research possible ENDEND 
With a world war raging and the country still emerging from depression, the federal government could have ignored their plight or told them to find a cure on their own ENDEND 
But that didn't happen ENDEND  Instead, Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped galvanize a community of compassion and organize the March of Dimes to find the cure for polio ENDEND  And while Roosevelt knew that his own polio would never be cured by the discovery of a vaccine, he also knew that at its best, government can be used as a force to accomplish together what we cannot achieve on our own ENDEND 
And so the people began to care and the dimes piled up and the funding started to flow, and fifty years ago, Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine ENDEND 
Americans are looking for that kind of leadership today ENDEND  All over the country, patients and their families are waiting today for Congress and the President to open the door to the cures of tomorrow ENDEND  At the dawn of the st century, we should approach this research with the same passion and commitment that have led to so many cures and saved so many lives throughout our history ENDEND 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 
Well, good evening, everybody ENDEND  On behalf of Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House ENDEND  Over the past eight years, this has always been one of our favorite nights ENDEND  And this year, I was especially looking forward to seeing how Joe Walsh cleans up  pretty good ENDEND 
I want to begin by once again thanking everybody who makes this wonderful evening possible, including David Rubenstein, the Kennedy Center Trustees  I’m getting a big echo back there  and the Kennedy Center President, Deborah Rutter ENDEND  Give them a big round of applause ENDEND 
We have some outstanding members of Congress here tonight ENDEND  And we are honored also to have Vicki Kennedy and three of President Kennedy’s grandchildren with us here – Rose, Tatiana, and Jack ENDEND 
So the arts have always been part of life at the White House, because the arts are always central to American life ENDEND  And that’s why, over the past eight years, Michelle and I have invited some of the best writers and musicians, actors, dancers to share their gifts with the American people, and to help tell the story of who we are, and to inspire what’s best in all of us ENDEND  Along the way, we’ve enjoyed some unbelievable performances – this is one of the perks of the job that I will miss ENDEND 
Thanks to Michelle’s efforts, we’ve brought the arts to more young people – from hosting workshops where they learn firsthand from accomplished artists, to bringing “Hamilton” to students who wouldn’t normally get a ticket to Broadway ENDEND  And on behalf of all of us, I want to say thanks to my wife for having done simply ENDEND  Yes ENDEND  And she’s always looked really good doing it ENDEND  She does ENDEND 
This is part of how we’ve tried to honor the legacy of President and Mrs ENDEND  Kennedy ENDEND  They understood just how vital art is to our democracy  that we need song and cinema and paintings and performance to help us challenge our assumptions, to question the way things are, and maybe inspire us to think about how things might be ENDEND  The arts help us celebrate our triumphs, but also holds up a mirror to our flaws ENDEND  And all of that deepens our understanding of the human condition ENDEND  It helps us to see ourselves in each other ENDEND  It helps to bind us together as a people ENDEND 
As President Kennedy once said, “In serving his vision of the truth, the artist best serves his nation ENDEND ” Tonight, we honor five amazing artists who have dedicated their lives to telling their truth, and helping us to see our own ENDEND 
At eight years old, Mavis Staples climbed onto a chair in church, leaned into the microphone, raised her eyes upwards and belted out the gospel ENDEND  When people heard that deep, old soul coming out of that little girl, they wept  which, understandably, concerned her ENDEND  But her mother told her, “Mavis, they’re happy ENDEND  Your singing makes them cry happy tears ENDEND ”
It was those early appearances on the South Side of Chicago – South Side  with Mavis, her siblings, their father, Roebuck “Pops” Staples that launched the legendary Staple Singers ENDEND  Theirs was gospel with just a touch of country, a twist of the blues, little bit of funk ENDEND  There was a little bit of sin with the salvation ENDEND  And driven by Pops’ reverbed guitar, Mavis’ powerhouse vocals and the harmonies that only family can make, the Staple Singers broke new ground with songs like “Uncloudy Day ENDEND ” They had some truths to tell ENDEND  Inspired by Dr ENDEND  King, Pops would tell his kids, “If he can preach it, we can sing it ENDEND ” And so they wrote anthems like “Freedom Highway,” and “When Will We Be Paid”  which became the soundtrack of the Civil Rights movement ENDEND 
As a solo artist, Mavis has done it all and worked with just about everybody from Bob Dylan to Prince to Jeff Tweedy ENDEND  On albums like “We’ll Never Turn Back,” and “One True Vine,” she still is singing for justice and equality, and influencing a new generation of musicians and fans ENDEND  And each soulful note  even in heartbreak and even in despair – is grounded in faith, and in hope, and the belief that there are better days yet to come ENDEND  “These aren't just songs I'm singing to be moving my lips,” she says ENDEND  “I mean this ENDEND ” And we mean it too ENDEND  Six decades on, nobody makes us feel “the weight” like Mavis Staples ENDEND  Give her a big round of applause ENDEND 
Al Pacino calls the theater his “flashlight ENDEND ” It’s how he finds himself, where he sees truth ENDEND  And since Al first hit Broadway in , his singular talent has been the gold standard for acting ENDEND 
A great playwright once compared the way Al inhabits his characters to the way Louis Armstrong played jazz ENDEND  One director said that while “some actors play characters, Al Pacino becomes them ENDEND ” And we’ve all seen it ENDEND  In the span of five years  you think about it  he became Serpico, became Sonny Wortzik, twice became Michael Corleone for, let’s face it, what have got to be the two best movies of all time, became Tony Montana on screen, then became the owner of a couple of Tonys on stage ENDEND  And he’s always been this way ENDEND 
At , Al committed so profoundly to a role in the school play that when his character was supposed to get sick on stage, Al actually got sick on stage ENDEND  I’m not sure how audiences felt about that ENDEND  Later, when he played Richard III and Jackie Kennedy visited him backstage, the actor playing the selfabsorbed king didn’t even stand up to greet actual American royalty, which he says he still regrets ENDEND 
Through it all, Al has always cared more for his “flashlight” than the spotlight ENDEND  He says he’s still getting used to the idea of being an icon ENDEND  But his gift, for all the inspiration and intensity that he brings to his roles, is that he lets us into what his characters are feeling ENDEND  And for that, we are extraordinarily grateful ENDEND  Al Pacino ENDEND 
In the late sixties, James Taylor got the chance to audition in front of Paul McCartney and George Harrison ENDEND  Ringo, I don’t know if you were there  but this is a true story ENDEND  “I was as nervous as a Chihuahua on methamphetamines" is what James Taylor says ENDEND  Which is exactly the kind of metaphor that makes him such a brilliant songwriter ENDEND 
But if James has a defining gift, it is empathy ENDEND  It’s why he’s been such a great friend to and Michelle and myself ENDEND  We're so grateful to him and Kim for their friendship over the years ENDEND  It’s why everybody from Carole King to Garth Brooks to Taylor Swift collaborates with him ENDEND  It’s what makes him among the most prolific and admired musicians of our time ENDEND  In fact, James recently went through all his songs and kept coming across the same stories  songs about fathers and traffic jams; love songs, recovery songs ENDEND  I really love this phrase: “Hymns for agnostics ENDEND ” He says that in making music, “There’s the idea of comforting yourself ENDEND  There’s also the idea of taking something that’s untenable and internal and communicating it ENDEND ” And that's why it feels like James is singing only to you when he sings ENDEND  It feels like he's singing about your life ENDEND  The stories he tells and retells dwell on our most enduring and shared experiences ENDEND  “Carolina on My Mind” is about where you grew up, even if you didn’t grow up in Carolina ENDEND  “Mean Old Man” is probably somebody you know ENDEND  “Angels of Fenway”  well, actually, that’s just about the Red Sox ENDEND  So if you're a White Sox fan you don’t love that song, but it's okay ENDEND 
James is the consummate truthteller about a life that can leave us with more unresolved questions than satisfying answers, but holds so much beauty that you don’t mind ENDEND  And from his honesty about his own struggles with substance abuse to his decades of progressive activism, James Taylor has inspired people all over the world and helped America live up to our highest ideals ENDEND  Thank you, James Taylor ENDEND 
Without a preschool rivalry, we might not be honoring Martha Argerich ENDEND  The story goes that when Martha was two years old, a little boy taunted her, saying, “I bet you can’t play the piano” So she sat down at the keys, remembered a piece her teacher had played, and played it flawlessly ENDEND  By eight years old, she had made her concert debut ENDEND  By the time she was a teenager, she left her native Argentina to study in Vienna and won two major international competitions, launching one of the most storied and influential careers in classical music ENDEND  That little boy lost his bet ENDEND 
Martha combines unparalleled technical prowess with passion and glittering musicianship ENDEND  From Bach to Schumann, she doesn’t just play the piano, she possesses it ENDEND  Martha can charge through a passage with astonishing power and speed and accuracy, and, in the same performance, uncover the delicate beauty in each note ENDEND  As a critic once wrote, “She is an unaffected interpreter whose native language is music ENDEND ”
But what truly sets her apart and has cemented her place as one of the greatest pianists in modern history is her dogged commitment to her craft ENDEND  In an age of often superficial connections, where people too often seek fame and recognition, Martha has been guided by one passion, and that is fidelity to the music ENDEND  She can only be herself ENDEND  And that is the truest mark of an artist ENDEND  And the result is timeless, transcendent music for which we thank Martha Argerich ENDEND 
And finally, there have been some interesting things said about this next group, including being called "one of rock's most contentiously dysfunctional families ENDEND " So, yeah, it was unlikely that they'd ever get back together and that they called their reunion tour "Hell Freezes Over ENDEND " I love that ENDEND  But here's the thing  when you listen to the Eagles, you hear the exact opposite story, and that is perfect harmony ENDEND 
You hear it in the crisp, overpowering a capella chords of "Seven Bridges Road"; dueling guitar solos in "Hotel California"; complex, funky riffs opening "Life in the Fast Lane ENDEND " It's the sound not just of a California band, but one of America's signature bands  a supergroup whose greatest hits sold more copies in the United States than any other record in the th century ENDEND  And the th Century had some pretty good music ENDEND 
So, here tonight, we have three of the Eagles: Don Henley, the meticulous, introspective songwriter with an unmistakable voice that soars above his drum set ENDEND  Timothy Schmit, the bass player and topline of many of those harmonies ENDEND  And Joe Walsh, who’s as rowdy with a guitar lick as I’m told he once was in a hotel room ENDEND  Twice ENDEND  This is the White House, though ENDEND  And Michelle and I are about to leave ENDEND  As I've said before, we want to get our security deposit back ENDEND 
But, of course, the Eagles are also the one and only Glenn Frey ENDEND  And we all wish Glenn was still here with us ENDEND  We are deeply honored to be joined by his beautiful wife, Cindy, and their gorgeous children ENDEND  Because the truth is that these awards aren't just about this reception or even the show we have this evening, which will be spectacular ENDEND  The Kennedy Center Honors are about folks who spent their lives calling on us to think a little harder, and feel a little deeper, and express ourselves a little more bravely, and maybe “take it easy” once in a while ENDEND  And that is Glenn Frey  the driving force behind a band that owned a decade, and did not stop there ENDEND  We are all familiar with his legacy ENDEND  And the music of the Eagles will always be woven into the fabric of our nation ENDEND 
So we are extraordinarily honored to be able to give thanks for the Eagles ENDEND  And what's true for them is true for all of tonight’s honorees: remarkable individuals who have created the soundtrack to our own lives  on road trips, in jukebox diners; folks who have mesmerized us on a Saturday night out at the movies or at a concert hall ENDEND 
Mavis Staples ENDEND  Al Pacino ENDEND  James Taylor ENDEND  Martha Argerich The Eagles ENDEND  Their legacies are measured not just in works of art, but the lives they've touched, and creating a stronger and more beautiful America ENDEND  They’re artists who have served our nation by serving their truth ENDEND  And we’re all better off for it ENDEND 
So before we transport ourselves to what I'm sure will be a spectacular evening, please join me in saluting our extraordinary  Kennedy Center Honorees ENDEND 

Good evening, everybody ENDEND  Let me begin by thanking President Kuczynski and the wonderful people of Peru for hosting us and for their outstanding hospitality ENDEND  Peru is one of the United States’ strongest partners in the Americas  from standing up for democracy, to promoting jobs and growth, to fighting climate change ENDEND  And this summit has been a success thanks to the great work of our Peruvian friends ENDEND  So on behalf of us all, muchas gracias ENDEND 
This summit, and my trip over the past week, has obviously occurred against a backdrop of the broader debate over globalization and trade ENDEND  As I’ve said, over the decades, our global, integrated economy has helped to improve the lives of billions of people around the world with historic gains in prosperity, education, and health ENDEND  At the same time, when jobs and capital can move across borders, when workers have less leverage, when wealthy corporations and global elites too often seem to be playing by a different set of rules, then workers and communities can be hit especially hard; the gaps between the rich and everyone else grow wider ENDEND  And that can reverberate through our politics ENDEND 
That’s why I firmly believe that one of our greatest challenges in the years ahead  across our nations and within them  will be to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are shared by more people and that the negative impacts, such as economic inequalities, are addressed by all nations ENDEND  When it comes to trade, I believe that the answer is not to pull back or try to erect barriers to trade ENDEND  Given our integrated economies and global supply chains, that would hurt us all ENDEND  But rather the answer is to do trade right, making sure that it has strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, that it addresses ways in which workers and ordinary people can benefit rather than be harmed by global trade ENDEND  All of this is the central work of APEC ENDEND 
As this debate moves forward in the United States, it’s important to remember how vital the Asia Pacific is to America’s prosperity ENDEND  The  Asia Pacific economies here represent nearly three billion people, a majority of the global middle class, six of America’s top  trading partners, more than half of the global economy, and the world’s fastestgrowing region ENDEND  In other words, these  countries represent tremendous opportunity for the United States to sell our goods and support United States   jobs ENDEND  And that’s why, as part of the rebalance of our foreign policy to the Asia Pacific, we’ve boosted United States   exports to the region by some  percent ENDEND  Nearly  percent of our exports go to the region ENDEND 
And this is part of broader progress ENDEND  With  percent of the world’s customers beyond America’s borders, I’ve made it a priority to open up new markets overseas ENDEND  And during my Administration, we’ve increased United States   exports to the world by more than  percent  to record levels  and these exports support more than  million American jobs ENDEND  Moreover, we know that companies that export tend to grow faster and hire more employees and pay their workers more than companies that do not export ENDEND  All of which is why exports have helped to drive our economic recovery ENDEND  It's one of the reasons that United States   businesses have created more than  million new jobs ENDEND 
So that’s the kind of progress that trade  when done right  can deliver ENDEND  And that’s the kind of work that we’ve tried to do here at this summit ENDEND  We’re continuing our work to make it easier to do business between our countries so we’re creating even more jobs ENDEND  In the United States, we’re simplifying the process of starting a new business, increasing access to credit, all of which will help more ventures  especially small businesses  get up and running, and helping them to be able to export as well, so that they can access a global market even if they can't afford fancy lawyers and accountants and foreign offices ENDEND 
We agreed to increase our collective effort against corruption by targeting the bribery that enriches elites at the expense of people ENDEND  And we committed to making it easier to trade in services as well as goods ENDEND 
We also discussed the excess capacity that exists in certain sectors, like steel and aluminum that distorts markets and hurts business and workers, including American workers ENDEND  And even as I've argued that we cannot engage in protectionist measures, my Administration has been at the forefront of really cracking down hard on unfair trade practices and brought, consistently, cases against the  cases under the WTO against those who are engaging in unfair trading practices, and we've had a great track record of trade enforcement that has to be a part of this process ENDEND 
I’ve been very clear that excess capacity is not the result of market forces; it’s the result of specific government policies, and it needs to be fixed ENDEND  And here at APEC, we've been taking steps, as we were at the G in Hangzhou, to start addressing these issues in a systematic way ENDEND 
With regard to the digital economy, we endorsed rules to protect the privacy of personal information as it crosses borders ENDEND  We discussed the importance of maintaining the current moratorium on customs duties for digital goods and innovation ENDEND  And given growing cyber threats, our  APEC economies affirmed that no one should conduct or support cyberenabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, with the intent to providing a competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors ENDEND 
We’re also moving ahead with making our economies more inclusive ENDEND  And one particular area of focus is making sure that women have fair access to economic growth  expanding education; expanding access to careers in science, technology, engineering and math; helping more women entrepreneurs to access finance and integrate their businesses into the global supply chain ENDEND  According to one study, if women around the world participated in the labor force, it could add up to  trillion of additional output for the global economy   trillion ENDEND  When women are more prosperous, then families, communities and countries are all more prosperous as well ENDEND 
My meeting yesterday with my fellow leaders of the TransPacific Partnership was a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the TPP, with its high standards, strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property and human rights ENDEND  Our partners made very clear during the meeting that they want to move forward with TPP; preferably, they’d like to move forward with the United States ENDEND  A number of countries already are starting to ratify TPP ENDEND 
At the same time, we’re already hearing calls for a less ambitious trade agreement in the region with lower standards, lower protections for workers, lower protections for the environment ENDEND  That kind of agreement would obviously exclude United States   workers and businesses and access to those markets ENDEND  So for all those reasons, I believe that TPP is a plus for America’s economy, America’s workers, American jobs ENDEND  I think not moving forward would undermine our position across the region and our ability to shape the rules of global trade in a way that reflects our interests and our values ENDEND 
Finally, our cooperation with APEC has been critical to our historic progress in fighting climate change  bringing the Paris agreement into force, agreeing to limit aviation emissions, phrasing out dangerous HFCs ENDEND  Here in Lima, we continue our work to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and countries made new commitments toward our goal of doubling our renewable energy over the next two decades ENDEND 
So, as I wrap up my last summit and likely my last foreign trip as President, I could not be more proud of the progress that we’ve made together ENDEND  Obviously, the work is never done ENDEND  And given the prosperity and security we seek for not only the United States but our allies and our partners, I continue to believe that America will have a vital role to play in creating and sustaining a strong, enduring leadership role in the Asia Pacific ENDEND 
So, with that, let me take some questions ENDEND  And I'll start with Darlene Superville of AP ENDEND 
You’ve been telling world leaders this week that Presidentelect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned ENDEND  But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he’s chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia’s alleged meddling in the United States   election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year’s campaign will be the new normal going forward in future United States   elections?
 Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the Presidentelect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern ENDEND  And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet ENDEND  And so people should take a waitandsee approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign ENDEND 
My simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy ENDEND 
I can't be sure of anything ENDEND  I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see ENDEND  But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world ENDEND 
And I can't guarantee that the Presidentelect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken ENDEND  But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues ENDEND  That's just the way this office works ENDEND 
And I've said before, if these issues were easy  if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries  if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President ENDEND  And I'm a pretty good presidential historian; I've looked at my  predecessors, and it seems like for all of them  even the best ones  that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate ENDEND  I think the same will happen here ENDEND  And that's a good thing ENDEND  That's an important thing ENDEND 
With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting ENDEND  We talked briefly while we were in between sessions ENDEND  And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo, and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian ceasefire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort ENDEND 
And I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done ENDEND  I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with Frances, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up ENDEND  As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy ENDEND 
The issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward ENDEND  I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyberattacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack ENDEND 
I don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources  domestic, foreign, on social media  that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not ENDEND  And let me put it this way ENDEND  I think if we have a strong, accurate and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much ENDEND 
If, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside; the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside ENDEND  The good news is that's something that we have control over ENDEND 
That was a rhetorical question, that first one ENDEND  Rather than comment on hypotheticals, let me say specifically what I did ENDEND  Obviously, my assets were significantly smaller than some other Presidents or President-elects ENDEND  But we made a decision to liquidate assets that might raise questions about how it would influence policy ENDEND 
I basically had our accountant put all our money in Treasury bills  the yields, by the way, have not been massive over the course of the last eight years  just because it simplified my life ENDEND  I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me ENDEND 
And that's consistent with the broader approach that we've taken throughout my Administration, which is to not just meet the letter of the law, but to go well beyond the letter to the spirit of the law  not just for me, but for the people in the White House and in our leadership positions ENDEND 
We have established a whole set of rules, norms, playbooks that just keep us far away from the line ENDEND  Early on in the Administration, there would be questions about could a staff person go to this conference, or what should they do about this gift that was provided ENDEND  And I think it was maybe our first general counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said, if it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it ENDEND  That's a general test ENDEND  If it sounds like something you would enjoy or appreciate  no go ENDEND 
And as a consequence  and I'll knock on some wood here, because we got two months left  I am extremely proud of the fact that over eight years we have not had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other Administrations ENDEND  And when I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House Counsel that could provide clear guideposts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity ENDEND  And I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it ENDEND 
I know what worked for us, and I think it served the American people well ENDEND  And because I had made a promise to the American people that I would not fall into some of the familiar habits of Washington, that I wanted a new kind of politics, this was one indicator ENDEND  And at the end of eight years, I think I can say to the American people I delivered on that commitment ENDEND 
With respect to cyber, the NSA, Admiral Rogers is a terrific patriot and has served this country well in a number of positions ENDEND  I generally don't comment on personnel matters here ENDEND  I can say generally that we've spent a lot of time over the last several years looking at how we can organize our cyber efforts to keep pace with how rapidly the environment is changing ENDEND 
Increasingly, our critical infrastructure, government data, financial systems are vulnerable to attack ENDEND  And both state and nonstate actors are getting better and better at it, and it is becoming more and more rapid ENDEND  And it is inevitable that we're doing to have to modernize and update not just the tools we use to defend those assets and the American people, but also how we organize it ENDEND  And it is true that we are exploring a range of options in terms of how we organize the mission that currently exists ENDEND 
Rich Edson ENDEND 
Earlier this year, former President George W. Bush reportedly said that he worried he would be the last Republican President ENDEND  Now Republicans have won the White House, control the House and Senate, two-thirds of state legislatures,  governorships, and there are charges of a shallow Democratic bench behind you ENDEND  Are you worried you could be the last Democratic President for a while? And secondly, sir, speaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office ENDEND  Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you’ve accomplished? Thank you ENDEND 
 Well, no, I'm not worried about being the last Democratic President ENDEND  I think  not even for a while ENDEND  And I say that, not being cute ENDEND  The Democratic nominee won the popular vote, and obviously this was an extremely competitive race and I would expect that future races will be competitive as well ENDEND  I certainly think it's true that politics in America right now are a little up for grabs, that some of the old alignments within both parties  Democrat and Republican  are being reshaped ENDEND  And although the results of this election involved some of the specifics of the candidates and aren't going to be duplicated in every subsequent election, Democrats do have to do some thinking about how do we make sure that the message we have is received effectively and results in winning elections ENDEND 
This is something that I've been wrestling with throughout my presidency ENDEND  When you look at the proposals I put forward, they garner majority support ENDEND  The majority believes in raising the minimum wage ENDEND  The majority believes in commonsense gun safety rules ENDEND  The majority believes in investing to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs ENDEND  The majority believes in making sure that people aren't going bankrupt when they get sick ENDEND  The majority agrees with all the individual components of Obamacare ENDEND 
I think there was a Gallup Poll this week, subsequent to the election, that showed that the general public has a more favorable view of Democrats than Republicans ENDEND  And as I noted, my approval ratings are quite high ENDEND  And yet what’s been true during the course of my eight years is that does not always translate; in fact, too often it hasn't translated into working majorities either at the state level or at the federal level ENDEND 
Now, some of that is just the nature of our system, and geography ENDEND  As long as Wyoming gets the same number of senators as California, there’s going to be some tilt towards Republicans when it comes to congressional races ENDEND  The fact that a lot of Democratic voters are bunched up in big cities, and a lot of Republican voters are spread out across geography gives them an advantage when it comes to congressional races ENDEND 
Some of it is just political bad luck ENDEND  For example, I came in as an economy was in free fall, and although we took the right steps to save the economy, in my midterm election in , people couldn't yet see the recovery and, not surprisingly, the President’s party got punished ENDEND  We lost control of a lot of not just congressional seats but also gubernatorial seats and state legislative seats ENDEND  And that happened to be the year that the Census is done and you start doing redistricting, and those Republicans took advantage of political gerrymandering to lock in majorities, even though in numerous subsequent elections, Democrats have actually cast more votes  or more votes have been cast for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican ENDEND  And yet you end up having large Republican majorities ENDEND 
So there are just some structural problems that we have to deal with ENDEND  But, look, you can't make excuses about the rules ENDEND  That's the deal, and we got to do better ENDEND  And I think doing better, as I said, involves us working at the grassroots; not ceding territory; going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning but we're building up a cadre of young talent; we're making arguments; we're persuading; we're talking about the things that matter to ordinary people, day to day, and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people’s Twitter accounts ENDEND 
And if we do that, then I'm confident that we'll be back on track ENDEND  I don't think that there has to be a complete overhaul here ENDEND  I think that there does have to be better organization, a smarter message ENDEND  And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that's just microtargeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it's not going to win you the broad mandate that you need ENDEND  And ultimately, the more we can talk about what we have in common as a nation, and speak to a broad set of values, a vision that speaks to everybody and not just one group at a time, the better off we're going to be ENDEND 
I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get elected twice, is that I always tried to make sure that, not only in proposals but also in message, that I was speaking to everybody ENDEND 
You had a second part to your question?
Question: 
 Ah ENDEND  Look, I've said before, President Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in ENDEND  And my intention is to, certainly for the next two months, is finish my job ENDEND  And then, after that, to take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking ENDEND  So I want to be respectful of the office and give the Presidentelect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance ENDEND 
As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes ENDEND  But what I do know is, is that I have to take Michelle on vacation ENDEND 

And then, in terms of finishing your job, which you just mentioned, last week you exercised your executive authority on multiple fronts  finalizing oil and gas leasing rules on public lands, as well as issuing a fiveyear leasing plan, banning drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic ENDEND  Many Republicans say that you should hold off finalizing anymore rules as you're headed out the door because they oppose many of them  when they control both the executive and legislative branch next year ENDEND  What do you say to that suggestion?
 Well, on the second question, these are the same Republicans who suggested that they didn’t need to confirm a Supreme Court justice when I was nine months out until the next election ENDEND  I think their general approach seems to be that probably two days after my reelection, I should stop until the next election ENDEND  I don't think that that's what the Constitution calls for ENDEND 
The regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time ENDEND  They’ve been subject to extensive public notice and comment, and everybody has known they’ve been out there ENDEND  These aren't things that we've been surprising people with ENDEND  They’re wellconsidered, they’re the right thing to do ENDEND  They’re part of my task of finishing my work ENDEND 
And I recognize that when the new Administration comes in, and a new Congress comes in, that they will have the option of trying to undo some of those rules and regulations that we've put in place ENDEND  And that's their prerogative ENDEND  That's part of how democracy works ENDEND  But I feel very strongly these are the right things to do, and I'm going to make sure I do them ENDEND 
With respect to Syria, as I said I think even on this trip in a previous press conference, I am not optimistic about the shortterm prospects in Syria ENDEND  Once Russia and Iran made a decision to back Assad in a brutal air campaign and essentially a pacification of Aleppo, regardless of the potential for civilian casualties, children being killed or wounded, schools or hospitals being destroyed, then it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time ENDEND 
And the issue that obviously I've wrestled with for the last five years  how involved should the United States be? What are our legal constraints in such involvement? What are our moral obligations? What are our strategic interests? Those haven't changed ENDEND  I continue to believe that we did not have a legal basis for military intervention there; that it would have been a strategic mistake given the work we still had to do in Iraq, the counterISIL campaign, ongoing operations in Afghanistan; that we had worked tirelessly to arrive at a political transition of some sort that could alleviate the suffering and provide humanitarian access ENDEND  And we will continue to do that work all the way until the last day that me and John Kerry and others have the authority to speak for the United States government ENDEND 
But ultimately, it takes two  or in this case, four, or six, or eight  to tango ENDEND  And we're just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Assad, and Assad, as a consequence, has been emboldened ENDEND  Look, this is a man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble, and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power, when he had the option to peacefully engage in a transition that could have kept the country intact ENDEND  That's his mentality ENDEND  That's not a mentality we support ENDEND  That's a mentality that the Russians and the Iranians have been willing to support ENDEND  But at this stage, we're going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this in order for us to end the situation there ENDEND 
Now, our ability to go after ISIL I think can be sustained ENDEND  There’s no doubt that there will continue to be extremist forces in and around Syria because it's still going to be in chaos for quite some time ENDEND  There will be elements in Iraq, just as there have been elements in Afghanistan even after the Taliban we're swept out, even after we killed bin Laden ENDEND  But I think we can effectively reduce the risk and take their key external operators off the field ENDEND 
The thing I'm probably most concerned about is making sure that even as we do that, United States   policy, United States   statements, United States   positions don't further radicalize Muslims around the world, or alienate and potentially lawabiding Muslims who are living in Europe or the United States ENDEND  And that's why I think it's important for us to understand those are our key allies in this fight, not enemies ENDEND 
Given that, though, I wonder if you intentionally sought to approach this trip reflecting more on the powers of and influence of the presidency on the world stage so that you might be able to offer the kind of counsel to your successor that he has said he hopes to draw upon ENDEND 
And also, on a political note, you talked often during your reelection campaign about this fever that had consumed the Republican Party, an effective political strategy that they employed to block you even on issues where there might have been some common ground ENDEND  What would be your advice to Democrats who might see that kind of strategy as the same kind of path to taking back power that the Republicans employed? And related to that, what would your advice be to House Democrats about whether or not to reelect Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House?
 I'll work in reverse ENDEND  I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader ENDEND  So much of what we accomplished was accomplished because of her smarts, her tenacity, her legislative skill ENDEND  And I don't normally meddle with party votes, and certainly on my way out the door, probably I shouldn’t meddle here ENDEND  But I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi ENDEND  She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill ENDEND  And she does stuff that's tough, not just stuff that's easy ENDEND  She’s done stuff that's unpopular in her own base because it's the right thing to do for the American people ENDEND  I think she’s a remarkable leader ENDEND 
With respect to Democrats and Republicans and how Democrats should deal with a new Administration, I think you give them a hearing ENDEND  I certainly don't want them to do what Mitch McConnell did when I was elected  meet the day of and say our sole objective is to not cooperate with him on anything even if the country is about to go into a depression, so that we can gain seats in the midterms and ultimately defeat him ENDEND 
That's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games ENDEND  So that's not my advice to Democrats ENDEND  My advice to Democrats is know what you care about and what you stand for, and fight for your principles even if it's a hard fight ENDEND  If there are areas where the new Administration is doing something that's going to be good for the American people, find a way to work with him ENDEND  If you think it's going to be a problem, then say so, and make the argument ENDEND 
The touchstone is, what’s good for the American people ENDEND  And that's worked for me ENDEND  That means that at the end of the day  and at the end of eight years  I can look back and I can say that I consistently did what I thought was best ENDEND  It doesn’t mean you don't make mistakes, but it means that you're being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you ENDEND 
And in terms of reflecting on the United States   presidency as I've been traveling, I think the main reflection I have and the main advice that I give to the incoming President is the United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order ENDEND  And I say that as somebody who has gone out of his way to express respect for every country and its people, and to consistently acknowledge that many of the challenges that we face are not challenges that America can solve on its own ENDEND  But what I also know is that the basic framework of the world order coming out of World War II and then on through the end of the Cold War was shaped by a set of ideals and principles that have worked for the vast majority of people  not just America, but around the world ENDEND  The notion of democracy and rule of law, and a free press and independent judiciary, and open markets, and a social welfare state to moderate some off the sharp edges of capitalism, and lifting up issues of human rights, and investing in public health and development not just within our own borders but elsewhere in the world ENDEND  And working with multilateral institutions, like the United Nations; making sure that were upholding international norms and rules ENDEND 
That's what’s made the modern world ENDEND  And there have been times where we, ourselves, have not observed some of these norms as well as we should, and have been accused of hypocrisy ENDEND  Here in Latin America, there have been times where countries felt disrespected and, on occasion, had cause for that ENDEND  There are times where we haven't observed these values in our own country and have fallen short of our ideals ENDEND  But that basic structure is the reason why the world is much wealthier, much more secure, and, yes, less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant than it was  years ago ENDEND 
And that requires constant work ENDEND  It doesn’t just happen on its own ENDEND  I've said this in Europe ENDEND  I've said this in places where there’s this pushback against this modern order ENDEND  But you take an example like Europe  before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of  years ENDEND  In the second one,  million people were killed ENDEND  Not half a million, not a million, but  million ENDEND  Entire continents in rubble ENDEND 
In places like the Asia Pacific, before that order existed, you routinely saw famines of millions of people  not just concerns about low wages, but people dying because they didn’t have any food or drinking water, or died of cholera or simple diseases  if somebody had some penicillin ENDEND 
And so what I would say would be that we all share responsibilities for improving that order and maintaining it, and making sure it's more inclusive, and delivers greater hope and prosperity for more corners of the world ENDEND  We all have responsibilities  every nation  in respecting the dignity and worth of their citizens ENDEND  And America can't do it all for everybody else ENDEND  There are limits to our reach into other countries if they’re determined to oppress their people, or not provide girls education, or siphon off development funds into Swiss bank accounts because they’re corrupt ENDEND  We're not going to be able to handle every problem ENDEND 
But the American President and the United States of America  if we're not on the side of what’s right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we're not able to deliver at  percent everywhere  then it collapses ENDEND  And there’s nobody to fill the void ENDEND  There really isn't ENDEND  There are other very important countries  like a China  where if it weren't for China’s cooperation, we couldn't have gotten the Paris agreement done ENDEND  But China is not the one who was going around organizing  nations to sign on to a Paris agreement, or putting together the paper and the policy outlines and the conceptual framework ENDEND 
Russia is a very significant military power, but they’re not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti ENDEND  We are ENDEND 
And I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly ENDEND  And I would hope that not just the th President of the United States, but every President of the United States understands that that's not only a burden, but it's also an extraordinary privilege ENDEND  And if you have a chance to do that right, then you should seize it ENDEND 
All right? Thank you, everybody ENDEND 

 Hola Peru Asu Muchas gracias ENDEND  Thank you so much ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND  Everybody, please have a seat ENDEND  Thank you, Cyntia, for your kind words and your great work here in Peru in bringing people together across generations to meet challenges ENDEND  Please give Cyntia a big round of applause for the great introduction ENDEND 
So it is wonderful to be here in Peru ENDEND  I want to thank everybody at Catholic University of Peru for hosting us ENDEND  I want to thank the government and the people of this beautiful country for your hospitality ENDEND 
 I love you, too
So, while I'm here, I’m hoping to enjoy some good food  some pollo a la brasa ENDEND  Maybe a pisco sour ENDEND  But I will not be attempting the Marinera because I usually leave the dancing to my wife, Michelle ENDEND  She's a better dancer than me ENDEND 
But I want to thank all of you for being here  our Young Leaders of America, both live and online, representing every country in Latin America and the Caribbean ENDEND 
Now, this is my final stop on my final trip abroad as President of the United States ENDEND  And I’ve had the usual meetings with world leaders, and we've done important business ENDEND  But whenever I travel, one of the things that I've been trying to do for the last eight years is to meet with young people ENDEND  First of all, young people are more fun than old people ENDEND  Second, because today more than half of the world’s population is  or younger ENDEND  And that means your generation will determine the course of our future  as individual nations and as a global community ENDEND  Now, the good news is, because I've had a chance to meet so many young people around the world, it makes me very optimistic to know that you are going to be in charge ENDEND  And that's why I wanted my last public event abroad to be with you ENDEND 
I often say to young people in my own country: If you had to be born at any time in human history, it would be right now ENDEND  If you think about all the progress that's been made, not just in your lifetimes, but even in the last few years, fewer people than ever around the world live in extreme poverty ENDEND  Scientific breakthroughs are paving the way for cures to new diseases ENDEND  More children are going to school; more girls in particular are going to school than ever before ENDEND  People across the world are securing their human rights ENDEND  And technology has reshaped the world, as you can tell, because everybody has their phones ENDEND  At a time when Earth is now populated by more cell phones than people, you have the power to connect with each other across borders, across nations ENDEND  You have the tools in your hand to solve problems that we couldn’t even imagine when I was your age ENDEND 
Now, even as we make all these important strides in advancing the rights of more people, even as technology brings us closer together, this unprecedented change also brings challenges ENDEND  We see it in the widening gap between the rich and the poor around the world ENDEND  We see it in the forces of extremism and division that too often tear communities apart ENDEND  So the question for all of us is, how can we make sure that in this rapidly changing world, nobody is left behind and that all of us are stronger and more prosperous?
So over the last eight years as President, I've worked to strengthen our relationship with the Americas ENDEND  We’re more than just neighbors  we're linked by trade and culture, and family and values ENDEND  Our students study in each other’s countries ENDEND  Our businesses sell goods across borders ENDEND  Our tourists travel back and forth ENDEND  And we’ve moved beyond many of the old arguments to create a new vision for the future  one that your generation, which is liberated from old ways of thinking, can lead ENDEND 
During my presidency, the United States recommitted itself to the region, in partnership with your countries, based on mutual interests and mutual respect ENDEND  We increased trade ENDEND  We stood up for democracy and human rights, fought against corruption and organized crime ENDEND  We’ve promoted clean energy ENDEND  We’ve led the global fight against climate change ENDEND  We opened a new relationship with Cuba ENDEND 
I strongly believe that this work has to be done with governments, but it's even more important that it's done by people  because government is important, but it can't solve every problem ENDEND  So we have to work together at a peopletopeople level  teachers, and doctors, and students, and entrepreneurs, and religious leaders  all trying to find ways in which we can promote those values of dignity and humanity and respect that so often are threatened ENDEND 
And that's why we developed this Young Leaders Initiative ENDEND  Our goal is to find the most innovative young entrepreneurs, the most energetic civil society leaders like you, and help empower you with the training, and tools and connections so you can make a difference in your communities and your countries ENDEND  This network already has , people ENDEND  This fall, we welcomed the first class of  YLAI Fellows to the United States ENDEND  This is just  of them ENDEND  They're from every country across the Americas ENDEND 
We want to help ENDEND  So we want to help this generation with grants, seed funding, skills training ENDEND  Today, I’m announcing the launch of the Latin American and Caribbean Civil Society Innovation Initiative Hub, which is a way to virtually connect civil society organizations across the region so you can learn from each other, share your good work, support each other ENDEND  We’re investing  million in the talents and entrepreneurship of young people across the Caribbean to help start your own businesses and ventures ENDEND  We’re opening what we call the Global Innovation Exchange so that you can showcase your new business or enterprise to people around the world, and that way you can connect and hopefully get resources that you otherwise didn’t have ENDEND 
And we’re moving ahead with more education partnerships, like the , Strong in the Americas ENDEND  By the end of the decade, we want , United States   students studying in the Americas, and , students from the Americas studying in the United States ENDEND  And today, we’re announcing a partnership between the United States   Department of State, Sempra, and CAF, which is Latin America’s development bank, to fund the first Innovation Fund competition exclusively between Peruvian and United States   colleges and universities so students can come together to work on climate change and environmental science ENDEND 
So we're focused on the hemisphere, we're focused on the region ENDEND  But it's more than just North America, South America ENDEND  You're now part of a global network of young leaders from Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas who are doing amazing work in their own communities ENDEND  And while my time as United States   President is coming to an end, this network is just beginning  it’s never been more important ENDEND  We need you to stay connected, work together, learn from each other, so we can build that next generation of leadership who can take on challenges like climate change and poverty, can help grow our economies, make sure that women get opportunity ENDEND  Make sure that every child, wherever they live, has a chance to build a good life ENDEND 
And I’m going to just give you some examples of the amazing people that are involved in this process ENDEND  We need leaders like Dr ENDEND  Valéry Moise ENDEND  As a young doctor in Haiti, Valéry saw firsthand how issues like acute malnutrition  hunger  affected the poorest children in his country ENDEND  So he and a team of social workers and doctors started an organization called Diagnostik Group, which focuses on improving health care for abandoned children at the largest pediatric hospital in Haiti ENDEND  His goal is for the group to become the standard for pediatric care and to expand so that he can reach even more children across Haiti ENDEND  So thank you, Valéry, for the great work that you are doing ENDEND 
We need leaders like Abbigale Loncke of Guyana ENDEND  Abbigale, are you here? So after struggling to find her own grandfather home care, Abbigale realized this is a problem for so many other families, so she started Community Health Care, a home care agency ENDEND  She started out as a service to help families take care of their loved ones but now has a social movement that also provides training and job opportunities for young women in the health care industry ENDEND  So thank you, Abbigale, for the great work you’re doing ENDEND  And you already heard the great work that Cyntia is doing right here in Peru ENDEND 
Across the world and across the Americas, young people are taking the lead ENDEND  They’re seeing problems, they’re seeing injustice, and they are finding ways to take action ENDEND 
And the main message I want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the United States government ENDEND  And we are going to work together  we’re going to work together ENDEND  We expect the fellowships to continue, but I want you to know that I will also continue to be involved, even after I’m President, because I want to make sure that we continue to invest in your success ENDEND  If you succeed, not only do your countries succeed, but the world succeeds ENDEND  And I’m very excited to see all the great things you’re going to do in the future ENDEND 
So, muchas gracias ENDEND  Let’s take some questions ENDEND  And now we’re going to start with some questions ENDEND  I’m going to take off my jacket because it’s a little hot ENDEND  I wasn’t trying to get a cheer out of that but 
 All right, so we’re going to start with this question from this gentleman right here ENDEND  Please introduce yourself as you speak ENDEND 
Hold on, the mic is not working ENDEND  No, not yet ENDEND  Do we have a second mic? Testing  one, two, three ENDEND  Hold on, here's the technical expert ENDEND  Here we go ENDEND  Here's another one ENDEND  Not yet? Uhoh ENDEND  Uhoh ENDEND  Here we go ENDEND  We got to try this one ENDEND  One of these is going to work ENDEND 

I’m here to read a question from our YLAI network ENDEND  There were  questions posted on Facebook, but Carlos David Carrasco Muro from Venezuela asks: In Venezuela, there’s a debate about what matters most for stability, whether it’s peace or democracy ENDEND  How can we create a world where we do not have to choose between them? Both are important for development ENDEND 
Thank you very much ENDEND 
 Well, it’s a great question ENDEND  And it’s a timely question, because I think that after a decade in which we’ve seen more and more countries adopt democratic practices, you’re now starting to see some of those gains reversed ENDEND  You’re seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society ENDEND  And there are those who argue that democracy is incompatible with development because you need order, you need somebody from the top to tell people what to do in order to achieve ENDEND 
And I would just suggest that you look at the evidence over the last , ,  years ENDEND  Those countries that pursue democracy, that pursue transparency, where their leaders are held accountable  those are the countries that are doing best ENDEND  Those countries that are repressive, that don’t respect democracy, that silence critics  they go backwards economically ENDEND 
And it makes sense when you think about it, because in this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas ENDEND  It’s not based on how much land you have, it’s not based on natural resources ENDEND  It’s based on your people ENDEND  And in a democracy, what we’re able to do is  people, through the freedom they enjoy, are able to create, start businesses, start organizations, solve problems ENDEND  And what’s also true then is, they’re able to hold the government accountable, so when the government doesn’t deliver for its people  if it engages in corruption, if its policies only benefit a few rather than the many  people can react and respond, and over time people get better policies from their governments ENDEND 
And look at what’s happened just along the coast here in Latin America ENDEND  If you look at Chile, Peru, Colombia  all of them are growing faster, all of them are doing better because of the new openness and democracy that exists in these countries ENDEND  And what’s true here is true around the world ENDEND 
Now, the one thing I have to say though is, democracy is more than just elections ENDEND  Democracy is also a free press ENDEND  Democracy is also freedom of religion ENDEND  Democracy is making sure that the rights of minorities are protected, not just the majority ENDEND  Democracy is rule of law and an independent judiciary ENDEND  So it’s a matter of all these elements coming together ENDEND 
But the main thing we’ve learned is that, in this knowledgebased society, you can maintain order for a while with repressive, nondemocratic governments, but it will rot from within ENDEND  Over time, those governments fail and those economies fail  because when they make mistakes, they try to hide them instead of trying to solve them ENDEND  When somebody has a legitimate criticism of a problem, it can be ignored because the politicians don’t have to answer ENDEND  And eventually, those societies end up doing much worse, oftentimes by increasing repression as people get more and more dissatisfied and then society breaks down ENDEND 
It’s also true, by the way, that nondemocratic countries are much more likely to get into wars with other nondemocratic countries ENDEND  Democracies tend to try to solve problems through diplomacy and dialogue ENDEND  So not only is there not a contradiction between democracy and development, it is my belief that in order, in this new knowledgebased economy, for development to be successful, you need democracy ENDEND 
I will say this one last thing, though ENDEND  Democracy can be frustrating, because democracy means that you don’t always get  percent of what you want ENDEND  Democracy means that sometimes you have to compromise ENDEND  And it means that the outcomes of elections don’t always turn out the way you would hope ENDEND  And then you  we're going through that in the United States, and I'm doing everything I can to help facilitate a successful transition with the Presidentelect in the United States ENDEND  But as long as we keep our democratic systems open, then the society has a chance to try something new, and then it can make a decision and correct problems that they see in the future, and progress will continue ENDEND 
Good ENDEND  All right ENDEND  Let's see  right there ENDEND  Yeah, you ENDEND  So let's get a microphone to you so we can hear you ENDEND  And introduce yourself ENDEND  By the way, I apologize, my Spanish is just okay ENDEND  So we're doing this in English, but hopefully I'm being clear ENDEND  Go ahead ENDEND 
 
You have some classmates here ENDEND  Well, the United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain ENDEND  And I think it will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments but give this new President-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be  because as I've always said, how you campaign isn’t always the same as how you govern ENDEND  Sometimes when you're campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions ENDEND  When you govern, you actually have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out how do I make this work ENDEND 
The alliance between the United States and Europe, through NATO, is very strong ENDEND  And the Presidentelect Trump has already reaffirmed our commitment to NATO ENDEND  We actually have been asking, under my administration, for Europe to carry more of the burden of defense spending than they've been doing, because the United States spends a lot more than some of our NATO partners ENDEND  And they recognize and acknowledge, I think, the need for them to spend more time  more resources on that ENDEND 
With respect to Latin America, I don't anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration ENDEND  I think the work that we've done has been successful in establishing the strongest relationships between the United States and Latin America in modern history ENDEND  The friendships that we've established with countries like Peru, the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the investments we're making in trade, in environmental policy, and so forth  all those things I expect to continue ENDEND 
There are going to be tensions that arise, probably around trade more than anything else, because the Presidentelect campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing some of those policies ENDEND  But once they look at how it's working, I think they'll determine that it's actually good both for the United States and our trading partners ENDEND  There may need to be modifications ENDEND  I've called for modifications in certain elements of our trading policy ENDEND  When we established the United States  Peru Free Trade Agreement, one of the requirements was for Peru to strengthen its protection of labor rights, workers' rights ENDEND  And we did that in part because, with all of our trading partners we don’t want to be disadvantaged because we're dealing with labor that has no rights, and so it gets the lowest wages and can be exploited ENDEND  But we did it also because that will help lift the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru enjoy, because ultimately that's good for everybody ENDEND 
One of the things that I really believe is that when you pay workers well, when ordinary people are getting a decent wage and decent benefits and decent protections, then they have more money in their pockets, and then they go out and they spend that money, which is good for business, and everybody is better off ENDEND  So that's the kind of attitude that we want to try to promote in the years going forward ENDEND  And my hope is, is that that policy will continue ENDEND 
So my message to you, though, and the message I delivered in Europe is, don’t just assume the worst ENDEND  Wait until the administration is in place, it's actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it's consistent with the international community's interest in living in peace and prosperity together ENDEND 
Okay ENDEND  Good ENDEND  All right ENDEND  Okay, so what I'm doing is I'm going boy, girl, boy, girl, so that everybody gets a fair chance ENDEND  Okay, this gentleman right here, in the purple shirt ENDEND 
Question: Thank you very much ENDEND  First of all, I just want to say thank you for being such a great world leader over your tenure ENDEND  I truly think that you've done your best in making the world a better place ENDEND 
 I appreciate that ENDEND 
Question: My name is Lubi Jorges  ENDEND 
 Where you are from, Lubi?
Question: I'm from the Bahamas ENDEND 
  ENDEND 
Question: I'm the son of two Haitian immigrants living in the Bahamas ENDEND  And I'm a human rights activist and also a radio talk show host ENDEND  I filter my advocacy work through radio, because it's a great form of communication in getting everybody involved ENDEND 
Nonetheless, you spoke about youth and us shaping the future and the direction of the world, and what it's going to be in the very near future ENDEND  But I'll give you a quick example of what I experienced and then a question that can apply to all of us here as young people ENDEND 
As a person being born to Haitian parents, immigrants, in the Bahamas, there is a certain perception on you not being a native ENDEND  And governments have fed on that over time ENDEND  And so the average individual that you would come into contact with, they would see you in a certain light ENDEND  And so the opportunities to assist then, to help your country, then are diminished ENDEND  For example, I'm trying to bridge the gap between Haitians and Bahamians in the Bahamas, but government officials and other individuals, they would have said, well, you're fighting for Haitians to take over the Bahamas  when it's not that ENDEND  I just want Bahamians and Haitians to live in peace in the Bahamas ENDEND 
And so if you had the opportunity to have all of our prime ministers and presidents in one room, and you had one word of advice that you could have given those leaders in regards to young people, and especially millennials, what would you say to those leaders?
 Well, you know, I've had that opportunity a number of times ENDEND  They don’t always follow my advice ENDEND 
But to your broader point  look, we live in a world that is smaller than ever before ENDEND  Because of the Internet, because of modern travel, your generation gets ideas and culture and your politics from everywhere, right? You are listening to everything from Rolling Stones, to Kendrick Lamar, to salsa, to reggaeton to right?
So what is true in music, what’s true in food is also true in terms of politics and ideas ENDEND  And the great thing about young people is, is that that’s made your identities both national but also international ENDEND  So people here are Peruvian, but you’re also people who care about what happens around this continent and around the world ENDEND  It means that you can be both proud of your Haitian heritage and live in the Bahamas, and also be concerned about what happens in Africa, or what is happening in Myanmar ENDEND  That’s a good thing ENDEND 
Now, I’ll be honest with you, older people sometimes are more threatened than younger people by this convergence because  you know, now that I’ve got gray hair, I see what happens as you get older  you get set in your ways and you are afraid of things that are new ENDEND  And oftentimes, politicians can feed into that sense that everything is changing so fast, let’s go back to our old identities  identities of race or tribe or nationality ENDEND 
And my main advice, not just to world leaders, but more importantly to citizens around the world is, if you’re defining yourself just by what you’re not, if you’re defining yourself just by the color of your skin or where you were born, then you are not fully appreciating what will give you a strong identity and meaning in your life, and what will lead to prosperity and security for everyone ENDEND  And that is the values and ideals that we should all promote: That we respect everybody, regardless of what they look like ENDEND  That we give everybody opportunity no matter where they were born, whether they were born poor or they were born rich ENDEND  That we have laws that everybody has to observe, not just laws for one set of people and then a different set of laws for other people ENDEND 
Because the problem with that approach  a very narrow way of thinking about yourself  is that that means almost inevitably you have to be in conflict with somebody else ENDEND  If the most important thing about you is that you are an American  if that’s the one thing that defines you  then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities ENDEND 
Now, I’m a very proud American, and my job as President of the United States is to look out for American interests ENDEND  But my argument to the American people has always been, the best way for us to look out for American interests is to also care about what’s happening in our neighborhood ENDEND  Because if their house is burning down, eventually my house will burn down ENDEND  The best way for my daughters to be secure as Americans is to make sure that people in El Salvador or Guatemala are also feeling some security, because if they’re not, then eventually that may spill over the borders to us ENDEND 
And some of the challenges that we face today are ones that no single group can solve ENDEND  If you look at something like climate change  that knows no borders ENDEND  If there is pollution in China, it affects you here in Peru ENDEND  If we are going to make sure that the oceans don’t rise so that suddenly all of the streets around Lima are two feet underwater, then it’s going to require everybody taking the kind of collective action that we talked about in the Paris Agreement ENDEND 
So I think that we should all have the capacity, and governments should reflect this capacity, to be proud of our particular circumstance, be proud that you’re Haitian, be proud that you’re in the Bahamas, be proud that you’re a young, black man ENDEND  Be proud of your particular identity, but also see what you have in common with people who don’t look like you or don’t come from the same place as you do ENDEND  Because if we see what we have in common, then we’re going to be able to work together and that’s going to be good for all of us ENDEND  If all we see is differences, then we’re automatically going to be in competition  and in order for me to do well, that means I have to put you down, which then makes you want to put me down, and everybody stays down here instead of everybody lifting each other up ENDEND  It’s the most important thing we can do ENDEND 
All right, so it’s a woman’s turn ENDEND  Okay, everybody is pointing at this young lady ENDEND  All her friends were pointing at her, so she has something very important to say ENDEND 

So what do you recommend to open more quality education or job opportunities for young people in Latin America?
 Well, the program you described is doing great work, and there’s a lot of good work all across Latin America ENDEND  One of the goals is to make sure that not only are we providing a great education for people at the youngest ages  basic reading, arithmetic, all those things  but today you also need to have some knowledge of technology ENDEND  And what we’re trying to do is to work with governments and NGOs to expand access to the Internet, to digital platforms ENDEND  And what we also want to do then is to help design curriculum and programs through the Internet so that online learning is accessible in places where previously there might not be opportunities ENDEND 
And we’re seeing some of those investments here in Peru ENDEND  That’s part of the broader educational program that we have throughout Latin America ENDEND  But we can still do more ENDEND  And it’s not just us, it’s a publicprivate partnership also ENDEND  So having Facebook participate, and Microsoft and Google and other big companies who have an interest in an educated population  because the more educated and more wired they are, the more, over time, customers are using their products and their platforms ENDEND 
What we want to do is to make sure that everybody, even in the smallest village, has suddenly this library to the world and to the best educational opportunities, even if there’s not a big university in that small town ENDEND  And some of the learning that we can do, it doesn’t have to be four years ENDEND  Sometimes, a sixweek program could teach people coding in computers, and suddenly right away that person has a job, and then they can learn more and ultimately go and get a fouryear education ENDEND  But oftentimes what you need is just that first step ENDEND 
And we’re doing this in the United States, by the way ENDEND  It's not just in Latin America ENDEND  In the United States, one of the things that we're finding is that we need to expand computer science and literacy in the schools ENDEND  We need to make sure, also, that we set up technical training systems where somebody who's unemployed in a city where there used to be a big factory but now the factory is closed; or because of automation and robots, fewer people are working there; those people who have lost their jobs, they may not be able to afford to just go to a fouryear university, give them six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks of training ENDEND  Get them in a job right now, and then over time they can learn even more ENDEND 
So, congratulations ENDEND  You guys are doing good work ENDEND 
All right ENDEND  Okay, so this is a team effort now ENDEND  It's good to see this cooperation ENDEND  Everybody is pointing at one person ENDEND  All right, this gentleman right here, right in the front ENDEND 
And I'm going to give a little bit of context to my question ENDEND  You see, the smartest man I know is my dad ENDEND  My dad was born in Cuba ENDEND  And when he was seven years old, he went to the United States to get an opportunity ENDEND  He lived all of his university life there, from community college to doctorate, and he managed to do a lot of things because the USA had an open, honest towards him ENDEND 
Today, many immigrants can bring innovation to the USA because it has still this open, honest policy ENDEND  But the administration that is set to go after you is allegedly saying that it will have a closed door policy ENDEND  In your opinion, what do you think that today the stand of the USA is for offshore innovators that want to leave their comfort zone to the USA, to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, to find  to strive? And what would be the damages of the USA closing their doors to these young innovators?
And a final remark, I hope you have two amazing last months of presidency ENDEND 
 Thank you ENDEND  Thank you very much ENDEND  Well, first of all, I know that your father is very proud that you said he's the smartest man you know ENDEND  I hope that Malia and Sasha would say the same thing about their father  I don’t know ENDEND  But I'm sure that made him feel good ENDEND 
Look, America is a nation of immigrants ENDEND  Those of you who visited America, if you walk in an American city  not just New York or Los Angeles, but St ENDEND  Louis or Indianapolis or Columbus, Ohio  if you walk down the street, you see people that look like they could be from anyplace ENDEND  Because the fact is, is that except for the Native American populations, everybody in America came from someplace else ENDEND  All of us are immigrants ENDEND  And that's been our greatest strength, because we've been able to attract talent from everywhere ENDEND 
I use this as an example: You notice that the United States did really well in the Olympics ENDEND  Now, some of that is because we're a big country, we're a wealthy country, so we have all these training facilities and we can do all kinds of  best equipment ENDEND  All that is true ENDEND  But you know what, China is a bigger country and spends a lot of money also ENDEND  The big advantage that America has, if you look at our team  actually, two big advantages ENDEND  First, we passed something called Title IX many years ago that requires that women get the same opportunities in sports as men do ENDEND  And that's why  one of the reasons the American teams did so well is the women were amazing, and just because they've gotten opportunities ENDEND  Right? Which teaches us something about the need to make sure that women and men, boys and girls, get the same opportunities ENDEND  Because you do better when everybody has a chance, not just some ENDEND 
But the second thing  you look at a United States   Olympic team and there are all kinds of different sorts of people of all different shapes and sizes ENDEND  And part of it is because we draw from a bigger genetic pool than anybody  right? We have people who  these little gymnasts, they're like this big ENDEND  Simone Biles came by the White House ENDEND  She's a tiny little thing ENDEND  Amazing athlete ENDEND  Then we have Michael Phelps, he's '" and his shoulders are this big ENDEND  And that's good for swimming ENDEND  He couldn’t do gymnastics, but he's a really good swimmer ENDEND 
The point is, is that when you have all this talent from all these different places, then you actually, as a team, do better ENDEND  And that's been the great gift of America ENDEND 
Now, what we have to do not just in the United States, but in all countries, is to find a way to have a open, smart immigration policy, but it has to be orderly and lawful ENDEND  And I think that part of what's happened in the United States is that even though the amount of illegal immigration that is happening has actually gone down while I've been President, the perception is that it has just gone up ENDEND  Partly this is because it used to be that immigrants primarily stayed in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, border countries, or in Florida ENDEND  And now they're moving into parts of the country that aren’t used to seeing immigrants, and it makes people concerned  who are these people, and are they taking our jobs and are they taking opportunity, and so forth ENDEND 
So my argument has been that no country can have completely open borders, because if they did, then nationality and citizenship wouldn’t mean anything ENDEND  And obviously if we had completely open borders, then you would have tens of millions of people who would suddenly be coming into the United States  which, by the way, wouldn’t necessarily be good for the countries where they leave, because in some places like in Africa, you have doctors and nurses and scientists and engineers who all try to leave, and then you have a brain drain and they're not developing their own countries ENDEND 
So you have to have some rules, but my hope is, is that those rules are set up in a way that continues to invite talented young people to come in and contribute, and to make a good life for themselves ENDEND  What we also, though, have to do is to invest in countries that are sending migrants so that they can develop themselves ENDEND  So you mentioned Cuba, for example, where your father fled ENDEND  He left in part because they didn’t feel that there was enough opportunity there ENDEND  Part of the reason I said let's reopen our diplomatic relations with Cuba is to see if you can start encouraging greater opportunity and freedom in Cuba ENDEND  Because if you have people who have been able to leave Cuba and do really well in the United States, that means they have enough talent that they should be able to do really well by staying at home in Cuba ENDEND 
There are enormously talented people here in Peru ENDEND  I don’t want all the young people in Peru to suddenly all go  I don’t want you to feel as if you have to go to New York in order to be successful ENDEND  You should be able to be successful right here in Lima, right?
So this is true in the Americas, it's true in Europe, where obviously they've been flooded  and it's been very controversial  with migrants, some of them displaced from war in Syria, but some of them just coming for economic reasons from Africa ENDEND  I just left meetings with European leaders, and we discussed the fact that if we're investing more in development in those African countries, and encouraging greater rule of law and less corruption and more opportunity in those countries, then people are less likely to want to come to Germany or Italy for their futures because they feel that they can make a future where they are ENDEND 
But this is an example of what I was saying earlier ENDEND  If we think only about, in very narrow terms, about our borders and what's good for us, and ignore what's happening everywhere else, eventually it will have an impact on us whether we like it or not ENDEND  Because the world is just much smaller than it used to be ENDEND 
Okay ENDEND  Let's see, we got  all right, young lady right there ENDEND  Go ahead, in the black ENDEND  Yes, you ENDEND 
Question: Oh, my God, thank you for this amazing opportunity ENDEND  More than a question  well, I have to introduce myself first, sorry ENDEND  I’m Jennifer Schell, and I’m from Venezuela ENDEND  We already talked a little about my country, but I just want to thank you for giving us the women’s opportunity to make us feel empowered ENDEND 
I’m the CEO and founder of the TrabajaMama, a social initiative that promotes values for mothers around the world ENDEND  I’m a mother ENDEND  I have a daughter, and it’s a little bit hard to become an entrepreneur ENDEND  And I know that you have been supporting woman empowerment ENDEND  You support a candidate who was a woman, Hillary ENDEND  You are supported by your wife, Michelle ENDEND  And what is 
 Michelle is amazing ENDEND 
Question: I’m sure, I’m sure ENDEND  I’m sure of that ENDEND  So I know how you have been telling a lot of advice for young leaders ENDEND  What I want  special advice for female entrepreneurs, for those who have to strive a little bit more, for those who are mothers who have to split their self, and ask herself, should I be a mother or should I be a professional ENDEND  I truly believe that we can be both at the same time, but I would like to hear it from you  an advice for all the women, potential women that are going to become a mother, will have our future generations ENDEND 
And on behalf of all my YLAI fellows, thank you for this amazing opportunity ENDEND  And all the fellows that are looking  there are more fellows looking right now from their countries because they couldn’t come to Peru, so thank you for all the fellows that are watching right us now ENDEND 
 Okay ENDEND  Well, it’s a great question ENDEND 
I mean, Michelle probably would have more to say about this because, you know, she’s gone through it as a professional woman ENDEND  But let me offer just a few observations ENDEND 
First of all, the leaders and the men in every country need to understand that the countries that are most successful are going to be the countries that give opportunities to girls and women, and not just boys and men ENDEND 
And if you look at which countries are doing best  most advanced, grow the fastest  it’s partly because you can’t have half the population uneducated, not working, out of the house, not in leadership positions, and expect to be as good as a country where  percent of the people are getting a good education, and having opportunities, and can do amazing things  starting a business or entering into politics or what have you ENDEND 
So this is not just a problem for girls and women; men have to also recognize, this is good for you ENDEND  And if you’re a strong man, you shouldn’t be threatened that women are doing well ENDEND  You should be proud that women are doing well ENDEND  And families where women have opportunity, that means they’re going to be able to bring in more income, which means the family as a whole is going to do better ENDEND 
And let’s be honest, sometimes, you know, that whole machismo attitude sometimes makes it harder for women to succeed, and sometimes that is coming even from those who love them ENDEND  So, men, those of you who end up being fathers and you’ve got daughters, you’ve got to lift up your daughters ENDEND  Just telling them they’re pretty is not enough ENDEND  You’ve got to tell them they’re smart, and you got to tell them they’re ambitious, and you have to give them opportunity ENDEND 
So once you have the whole country thinking in those terms, then you need to start having policies that can support women, and the most important thing, in addition to making sure that girls from an early age are getting a good education and that they’re not being told, oh, you can just do certain things  like engineering, that’s a man’s job, or being scientist, that a man’s job ENDEND  No, no  girls can do everything ENDEND  It can’t just be, you know, be a teacher  which is a wonderful profession, but, traditionally, women sometimes are just told there are a few things they can do  nurse, teacher  as opposed to anything ENDEND  Right?
So that starts  once you’ve done that, then you have to recognize that the big conflicts that women have in the professional world has to do with family and childrearing ENDEND  And for biological reasons, women have more of a burden than men do ENDEND  But it’s not just biology, it’s also sociology, all right? Men’s attitudes is, well, yeah, I don’t have to do as much ENDEND  And even in my marriage with Michelle, I like to think of myself as a modern, enlightened man, but I’ll admit it  Michelle did more work than I did with Sasha and Malia ENDEND 
So part of what societies can do, though, is they can help with, for example, having smart policies for childcare ENDEND  One of the hardest things for professional women, particularly when their children are still small and not yet in school, is who’s going to take care of my baby when I’m working, and how do I make sure that they’re safe and that they’re trusted ENDEND  So making sure that governments have policies in place that help ENDEND  Now, having a motherinlaw who helps, that’s also very useful ENDEND  But not everybody has the option where they have family members who are close by ENDEND  So that’s an example of something that we have to really work on ENDEND 
Then we have to put pressure on institutions to treat women equally when it comes to getting loans to start a business ENDEND  Up until just maybe  years ago, in some places  in the United States even  a husband had to sign a loan document with a bank, even though it was the wife’s business, even if the woman was the one making the money, it was her idea, it was her investment, she was doing all the work ENDEND  Because of these old stereotypes, you’re having men cosign ENDEND  That kind of mentality, that kind of discrimination still exists in a lot of institutions ENDEND 
So we have to push back against those, we have to fight against those ENDEND  Women who are successful, you have to then fight for the younger women who are coming behind you, and make sure that you are changing some of these attitudes ENDEND  If you are high up in a bank, then you got to make sure that these policies are good for women ENDEND  If you succeed in politics, then you have to help promote and encourage women who are coming behind you ENDEND 
So the last thing I guess I would say would be  I know that Michelle says this to our daughters: You can be a wonderful mom and have a wonderful family and have a really successful career ENDEND  You may have to kind of not try to do everything all at the same time exactly ENDEND  You may have to time things out a little bit and have a husband who supports taking turns a little bit ENDEND  So it may be that when the child is very young, you’re not doing something that is as hard, because having a really young child is already really hard, and you have to sleep sometimes ENDEND  But then as the child gets older, maybe that’s when you are doing something  maybe your husband is doing something that gives him more time to support that child ENDEND  So there’s going to have to be finding the right balance throughout your life in order to be successful ENDEND 
But congratulations on the good work you’re doing ENDEND 
All right, I've got time for  so I only have time for two more questions ENDEND  I'll call on that gentleman up there with the glasses, in the blue shirt ENDEND  No, no, right here ENDEND  Let him ask his question, and then I'll ask the last one ENDEND  
Right now we live in a world that maybe the bad is good, and the good is bad ENDEND  So what advice will you give them to chase their dreams, make the country better  not Peru, just worldwide? That will be my question ENDEND  Thank you ENDEND 
 Well, look, you're already doing so well ENDEND  I don’t know that I can give you the perfect advice ENDEND  But I'll tell you what I tell my young people who work in the White House and who I meet in the United States, because I think what's true in the United States is true for you, as well ENDEND 
We live at a time where you're always seeing bad news ENDEND  Everybody  bad news gets a lot of attention ENDEND  But the truth is that, in some many ways, the world is better now than it was  years ago or  years ago, or  years ago ENDEND  People are healthier today, they're wealthier today, they're better educated today ENDEND  The world, if you look overall, is less violent than it was ENDEND  Look at the th century  millions of people dying everywhere ENDEND  Look at Latin America and the wars that were taking place everywhere across the continent ENDEND  And so you actually are living in a time of relative peace and historic prosperity ENDEND 
And I say that so that you should feel optimistic about the future ENDEND  You shouldn’t feel pessimistic ENDEND  Yeah, you're always seeing bad news, but the truth is the world is in a place where it can solve its problems and be even better  years from now or  years from now ENDEND  You have to start with that hope, that sense of optimism inside you, because if you don’t feel that way, then you don’t bother to try to have an impact because you think, ah, every politician is corrupt and all the governments are terrible, and people are greedy and people are mean, and so I'm just going to look out for myself ENDEND  And then nothing gets better ENDEND  So you have to start knowing that things have gotten better and can continue to get better ENDEND  That's number one ENDEND 
Number two, I always tell young people to  and I don’t know if this translates well in Spanish  but I say: Worry more about what you want to do, and not what you want to be ENDEND  Now, here is what I mean ENDEND  I think a lot of people, they say to themselves, "I want to be rich," or they say to themselves, "I want to be powerful ENDEND " Or they say, "I want to be the President," or "I want to be a CEO," so they  or "I want to be a rap star ENDEND " So they say they have this idea, but the people I know who are most successful, usually they're successful because they found something that they really care about, and they worked at it and became really good at it ENDEND  And over time, because they were so good at what they did, they ended up being rich, or they ended up being powerful and influential ENDEND  But in the meantime, they were constantly doing what they enjoyed doing and learning, and that's what made them successful ENDEND 
So what I would say to all of you is, find something you care deeply about ENDEND  If you care about poor children, then find a way right now that you can start helping some poor children ENDEND  Don’t wait, saying to yourself, oh, someday, when I'm President of Peru I'm going to help poor children ENDEND  No, go now and find an organization or create an organization that is helping poor kids learn or be exposed to new experiences ENDEND  If you care about the environment, don’t wait ENDEND  In addition to your studies, you could start having an impact right now on trying to improve your local community, or trying to be involved in some of the work that's being done around things like climate change ENDEND 
The point is that once you decide what it is that you really care about, there are ways for you to now get involved and pursue that passion ENDEND  And if you pursue that passion and you get good at it, you're not going to change the world overnight  nobody does ENDEND  I mean, I eventually, at the age of , became a senator and then the President of the United States, but I worked for  years in poor communities, and worked on issues ENDEND  And hopefully I was doing some good, even before I was famous or powerful, so that if I hadn’t ended up being President I could still look back and say, I worked on the things that I cared about and I got something done that was important ENDEND  And that, I think, is the most important advice that I have for you ENDEND 
All right, last question ENDEND  It's a woman's turn ENDEND  So all the men, you can put your  all the boys can put their hands down ENDEND  It's a woman's turn ENDEND 
Okay, go ahead, right there ENDEND 
Question: Okay, first of all, my name is Melisa ENDEND  I represent Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas ENDEND  Besides, I'm a proud member of UPC  ENDEND  And once again, I want to welcome you to this amazing country ENDEND  And on behalf of this whole audience, I would like to thank you for this amazing opportunity ENDEND 
Okay, so my question is the following ENDEND  As it is well known, during your presidency you have stepped up and accepted mistakes you made yourself or maybe the team you're leading ENDEND  And that's  I believe that shows how you reaffirm your belief in introspection and how you want to leave the past behind ENDEND  What would your advice to us entrepreneurs, most of us, that would like to leave the mistakes  learn from them, step up, and leave what's the past in the past? Thank you, President ENDEND 
 Well, you know, I don’t  you shouldn’t ignore the past ENDEND  You should learn from it ENDEND  And you should learn from history, and learn from experience ENDEND 
The truth is that I was  right before I came to Peru, I was in Europe, and I started my trip in Athens ENDEND  And I went to the Parthenon, the birthplace of democracy ENDEND  And you look at all these buildings from ancient Greece, and you try to imagine all the things that were happening in that time, and it seems very long ago ENDEND  But the fact of the matter is, is that humanity keeps on making the same mistakes, and we oftentimes find ourselves dealing with the same problems and the same issues ENDEND  So studying our past, studying our history, is very, very important ENDEND 
But the main thing I tell you and I tell my own daughters is, you can't be trapped by the past ENDEND  There's a difference between understanding your past ENDEND  You need to know the history of Peru ENDEND  If you live in the United States, you need to know how America came about  and that includes both the amazing and wonderful things, but also the bad things ENDEND  If you want to understand America today, then you have to understand slavery, and you have to understand the history of immigration, and how the debates we’re having today about immigration aren’t that different from when the Irish or the Italians came and people were saying, we can’t have any more Italians and we can’t have any more Irish ENDEND  If you don’t know that then you aren’t going to understand the patterns that we are having today ENDEND 
But the point is, is that we have the power to make our own history ENDEND  We don’t have to repeat the same mistakes ENDEND  We don’t have to just be confined to what has happened before or what is going on today ENDEND  We can think differently, and imagine differently, and do things differently ENDEND 
The one thing that we should remember, though, is that even as we try to do things that are new, we should remember that change generally doesn’t happen overnight ENDEND  It happens over time ENDEND  So I say that to young people because sometimes they get impatient ENDEND  In the United States, sometimes people say to me, oh, why haven’t we eliminated racial discrimination in the United States? And I say, well, we’ve made a lot of progress since I was born ENDEND  In terms of human history, if you think on the scale of hundreds of years or thousands of years  in  years, the changes that have taken place have been amazing ENDEND 
So you have to understand that even though we can think differently, societies don’t move immediately ENDEND  It requires hard work, and you have to persuade people ENDEND  And sometimes you take two steps forward and then you take one step back ENDEND  And you shouldn’t be discouraged when that happens, because history doesn’t just move in a smooth, straight line ENDEND 
The good news is that we have more access to information than we’ve ever had before ENDEND  Young people are in a position to change the world faster than ever before ENDEND  And I am confident that if you are respectful of people and you look for what you have in common with humanity, if you stay true to the values of kindness, and respect, and reason, and trying to live together in peace, that the world will keep getting better ENDEND  And I’ll be looking forward to seeing all the amazing things that you do in the years to come ENDEND 
Okay? Thank you very much, everybody ENDEND 
Thank you ENDEND 

Chancellor Merkel: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to be able to welcome today for the sixth time the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to Germany ENDEND 
In his capacity as President of the United States, let us remind ourselves  visiting us in his capacity as candidate here in Berlin; we then met in BadenBaden ENDEND  We then met in Dresden and Buchenwald ENDEND  We saw each other when he gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate ENDEND  In Elmau, we met again at the G ENDEND  Then Hannover Faire comes to mind ENDEND  And today he is again here in Berlin ENDEND 
So eight years are coming to a close ENDEND  This is the last visit of Barack Obama to our country, to Germany ENDEND  I am very glad that he chose Germany as one of the stopovers on this trip ENDEND  And thank you very much ENDEND  Thank you for the friendship you’ve always demonstrated ENDEND  Thank you for the reliable friendship and partnership you demonstrated in very difficult hours of our relationship ENDEND  So let me again pay tribute to what we've been able to achieve, to what we discussed, to what we were able to bring about in difficult hours ENDEND 
It comes to mind, as I said, of those that had a bearing on the cooperation of our intelligence services, and I'm very grateful that Barack Obama, as President, very much put protection of privacy on the agenda today ENDEND  Due to the fact of Islamist terrorism all over the world and the threat of IS, we recognize how important the cooperation with intelligence services, first and foremost, also with the services of the United States is ENDEND  We need this cooperation ENDEND  And we say this from a German perspective very clearly and unequivocally ENDEND 
Our bilateral relations are very good, they’re very close ENDEND  In the areas of business, of the economy, the United States of America last year were our most important trading partner ENDEND  Both for Germany and the European Union, the European Union and the United States of America on the big, important economic areas for us, which is why I've always come out strongly in favor of concluding a trade agreement with the United States of America ENDEND 
We have made progress, quite a lot of progress ENDEND  They cannot be stopped, those negotiations ENDEND  But we’ll keep what we have achieved so far, and I'm absolutely certain that one day we will come back to what we have achieved and build on it ENDEND 
Because that is my deep conviction ENDEND  Globalization  and I think we share this conviction  is that globalization needs to be shaped politically ENDEND  It needs to be given a human face ENDEND  But we cannot allow to fall back into preglobalization times ENDEND  So this conclusion of trade agreements that go beyond the scope of mere tariff agreements, customs agreements, are most important, and I'm very pleased that we were able to bring this to fruition between Canada and the EU ENDEND 
We made great progress, particularly if we look at one of the great global issues  namely, climate protection ENDEND  Without the engagement of the current Administration under the leadership of Barack Obama, this Paris agreement would never have come about ENDEND  There has been a change in the attitude in the United States towards that agreement, but there is also better cooperation with China ENDEND  So last year, we were able to conclude a Paris climate agreement, which will lead the way for the rest of the world, which is groundbreaking ENDEND  And together with the sustainable development goals of the agenda  for the whole world, this is indeed a sea change, I think, that we see here, and, stepbystep, it will be implemented ENDEND 
There’s another point that I wanted to mention here, particularly, the engagement and commitment to Africa ENDEND  For us Europeans, Africa as a neighboring continent is of prime importance ENDEND  The development of African countries is in our very own vested interest ENDEND  We, as Germans, but also we, as members of the European Union, will have to deal with this ENDEND  It will be at the very top of our agenda ENDEND 
There are a lot of areas where we cooperate  the fight against ISIL, for example ENDEND  Here, Germany was able to contribute to a certain extent, in certain areas ENDEND  We'll continue to do so  for example, in supporting the Peshmerga, in air policing ENDEND  But we also have to acknowledge that the United States of America bear most of the burden ENDEND  They bear the brunt of this responsibility ENDEND 
So I take your remarks very seriously, Barack, that the European Union as a whole, but also Germany, needs to recognize that this is our alliance, our common alliance, our transatlantic alliance, that we have to step up our engagement ENDEND  Because, in the long run, we will not be allowed to accept this imbalance as regards the contributions we give to this alliance ENDEND  And we have understood this message, and we have started to react ENDEND 
We have worked very closely together, for example, in Afghanistan ENDEND  We're continuing to do so ENDEND  I'm very pleased that this military engagement, together with a political road map that we've developed, we were able to continue ENDEND  We want to bring about a political solution there ENDEND 
We work very closely together on the issue of annexation of Crimea and Russia’s attempt to actually conquer Ukraine ENDEND  And actually they did so  conquered part of the territory ENDEND  We tried to come to a peaceful settlement here on this ENDEND 
So our interests are very much aligned ENDEND  Our attempts of cooperation are very much aligned ENDEND  We continue to build on what we've already achieved in these last months of the Administration, and we will continue also with the new Administration ENDEND 
This is the end of an eightyear cooperation that was very close, indeed ENDEND  From a German point of view, GermanAmerican and EuropeanAmerican relations are a pillar of our foreign policy  a foreign policy that is obviously guided by interests, but that is very much also committed to shared values ENDEND  So we have a platform  democracy, freedom, respect of human rights  that we would like to see respected all over the world, and also a peaceful world order ENDEND  We have shared those values; we continue to share those values ENDEND  And obviously we will continue to cooperate with the new Administration ENDEND 
But today, I think a word of gratitude is at hand ENDEND  Thank you very much for this very close, very intensive cooperation ENDEND 
 Well, thank you so much ENDEND  It is wonderful to be back in Berlin ENDEND  This is my sixth visit to Germany ENDEND  It will not be my last ENDEND  I have somehow continued to miss Oktoberfest ENDEND  So that's probably something that is better for me to do as a former President rather than as President  I'll have more fun ENDEND 
It's also wonderful to be back with my great friend and ally, Chancellor Merkel ENDEND  As I reflect back over the past eight years, I could not ask for a steadier or a more reliable partner on the world stage, often through some very challenging times ENDEND 
So I want to thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and your commitment to our alliance ENDEND  And I want to thank the German people for the incredible partnership that our countries have been able to establish all these years ENDEND 
Last week marked the th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall ENDEND  The United States was proud to stand with the people of Germany as this nation and this continent reunited, and rebuilt, and reached for a better future ENDEND  And it’s a reminder that the commitment of the United States to Europe is enduring and is rooted in the values we share  values that Angela just mentioned: Our commitment to democracy; our commitment to rule of law; our commitment to the dignity of all people  in our own countries and around the world ENDEND 
Our alliance with our NATO partners has been a cornerstone of United States   foreign policy for nearly  years  in good times and in bad, and through Presidents of both parties  because the United States has a fundamental interest in Europe’s stability and security ENDEND  The commitment that Angela and I share to this guiding principle has formed the basis for our conversations this afternoon ENDEND 
We discussed our efforts to keep our countries competitive and to create jobs and opportunity on both sides of the Atlantic ENDEND  The negotiations on agreements like TTIP have been challenging, and obviously at a moment when there’s concerns about globalization and the benefits that accrue to particular people, it is important that those negotiations and channels of communication remain ENDEND  Because, ultimately, what we have shown over the last several decades is that markets and trade and commerce can create prosperity in all of our countries  that it's not a winlose situation, but it can be a winwin situation ENDEND 
And at a time when the European project is facing challenges, it’s especially important to show the benefits of economic integration by continuing to invest in our people and working to reduce inequality, both within and across our countries ENDEND 
I reiterated our hope that negotiations over the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU will be conducted in a smooth and orderly and transparent fashion, and preserve as closely as possible the economic and political and security relationships between the UK and EU ENDEND  And I continue to believe what I said in Hannover  that the EU remains one of the world's great political and economic achievements and that those achievements should not be taken for granted, that they need to be nurtured and cultivated and protected and fought for ENDEND 
Because the achievements that we've seen on this continent, in contrast to a divided Europe of the previous century, are ones that remind us of how important it is that we work together, and that we are willing to uphold principles that have resulted in unprecedented prosperity and security throughout Europe and around the world ENDEND 
With the threat of climate change only becoming more urgent, Angela and I focused on the need for American and EU leadership to advance global cooperation ENDEND  Both our nations were proud to join the Paris climate agreement, which the world should work to implement quickly ENDEND  Continued global leadership on climate, in addition to increasing private investment in clean energy is going to be critical to meeting this growing threat ENDEND 
Of course, we discussed our commitment to meeting shared security challenges  from countering cyber threats to ensuring that Iran continues to live up to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal ENDEND  I commended Angela for her leadership, along with President Hollande, in working to resolve the conflict in Ukraine ENDEND  We continued to stand with the people of Ukraine and for the basic principle that nations have a right to determine their own destiny ENDEND  And we discussed the importance of maintaining sanctions until Russia fully complies with the Minsk agreement ENDEND 
As part of the coalition against ISIL, we are putting that terrorist network under tremendous pressure ENDEND  Here in Berlin, this week, coalition members are meeting to ensure we remain unified and focused on our mission to destroy ISIL ENDEND  We are very grateful for the vital contributions Germany has made to this fight  training local forces in Iraq, sharing intelligence, providing reconnaissance aircraft, including the recent deployment of additional NATO AWACS ENDEND  And as Iraqi forces continue the liberation of Mosul, I am pleased that NATO will be meeting the commitment we made in Warsaw to begin training additional forces in Iraq, which started this January ENDEND 
We also continue to stand united with Germany and our NATO allies in our ongoing efforts to build peace and stability in Afghanistan ENDEND 
On Syria, it's clear that the indiscriminate attacks on civilians by the Assad regime and Russia will only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe, and that a negotiated end to the conflict is the only way to achieve lasting peace in Syria ENDEND  Angela and I also agreed on the need for a comprehensive and humane response to the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria and for the influx of migrants and refugees from around the world ENDEND 
We need to build on the progress achieved at the United Nations  Refugee Summit, which yielded new commitments from some  nations and organizations ENDEND  The United States is doing our part by increasing the number of refugees we resettle ENDEND  And I want again to commend Angela and, more importantly, the German people for the extraordinary leadership and compassion that you have shown in the face of what I know is a very difficult challenge ENDEND  You are not alone in trying to deal with this challenge ENDEND  This is not an issue that any one country should bear but is in need of an international response ENDEND  And I not only intend to make sure that we have put in place more robust support from the United States, but I'm hoping that that continues beyond my Administration ENDEND 
On this final visit, I am reminded of the visit I made here before I became President ENDEND  It was eight years ago ENDEND  I had no gray hair ENDEND  But I believe today what I said then: If you want a model for what is possible, if you want to see how to build a peaceful and prosperous and dynamic society, then look at Berlin and look at Germany ENDEND  Look at Chancellor Merkel ENDEND  Her personal story helps to tell the story of incredible achievement that the German people have embarked on and I think is something that you should be very proud of ENDEND 
It is not inevitable that we make progress; it requires hard work ENDEND  Sometimes it may seem as if progress is stalled ENDEND  But what the history of postwar Germany shows is that strength and determination and focus and adherence to the values that we care about will result in a better future for our children and our grandchildren ENDEND 
And on behalf of the American people, I want to thank the German people, I want to thank Chancellor Merkel, for your deep friendship and your steadfast partnership ENDEND Pull out your German, showing off ENDEND 
Question:  Has the American President calmed you in the sense that on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia  he has allayed your fears? And are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr. Trump, would you  as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again?
 Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics ENDEND  All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner ENDEND  And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so, in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last eight years ENDEND  And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding ENDEND 
So it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds ENDEND  If I were here and I were German, and I had a vote, I might support her ENDEND  But I don't know whether that hurts or helps ENDEND 
With respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office ENDEND  Russia is an important country ENDEND  It is a military superpower ENDEND  It has influence in the region and it has influence around the world ENDEND  And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation ENDEND 
I think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing, and they are having good relationships with their neighbors, and participating constructively on big issues like climate change ENDEND  So I’ve sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world ENDEND 
The values that we talked about  the values of democracy, and free speech, and international norms, and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity  those things are not something that we can set aside ENDEND 
And so on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we’ve had very significant differences ENDEND  And my hope is that the Presidentelect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the Presidentelect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms ENDEND 
And I don’t expect that the Presidentelect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people, or even if it violates international norms, or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates longterm problems in regions like Syria  that we just do whatever is convenient at the time ENDEND  And that will be something that I think we’ll learn more about as the Presidentelect puts his team together ENDEND 
I am encouraged by the Presidentelect’s insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change ENDEND  And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security I think is very important ENDEND 
And finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election ENDEND  As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyberattacks ENDEND  This isn’t new ENDEND  It’s not unique to Russia ENDEND  There are a number of states where we’ve seen lowlevel cyberattacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds ENDEND  And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, though we recognize Russia’s intelligencegathering will sometimes take place even if we don’t like it, there’s a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we’re monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening ENDEND 
I do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don’t see a cyber arms race ENDEND  A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn’t become a lawless, lowlevel battlefield ENDEND 
And we’ve started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G, the G, and at the United Nations  levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front ENDEND 
Chancellor Merkel:  Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I’m very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly ENDEND  Because this is all about the American people, it’s about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing Administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming Administration ENDEND  And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany ENDEND  And that is in our mutual interest ENDEND 
So we will continue this ENDEND  I will continue this with  I approach this with an open mind, and I’ll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with Presidentelect Donald Trump ENDEND 
Secondly, on Russia ENDEND  I can only repeat what the President said previously ENDEND  This is all about respecting certain principles ENDEND  And I’m saying this from a European vantage point, from a German vantage point ENDEND  So the fact that for over  years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected ENDEND  In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud ENDEND  We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts ENDEND 
But we are pinning our hopes on political efforts ENDEND  This is why we launched the Normandy Process, in close coordination with the United States of America ENDEND  And particularly from a German perspective, from the European perspective, I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor ENDEND  Just look at Poland  the sort of European perspective this has ENDEND  So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one ENDEND  We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share ENDEND  But this mustn’t keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but, again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements ENDEND 
And this what I’m going to continue to work on with all my heart ENDEND  So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today ENDEND 

Will you want to now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under the your Administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well?
And a personal question ENDEND  President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician ENDEND  You are somewhat more sober when you describe your partner ENDEND  How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner?
 My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it’s not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world ENDEND 
And based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I’ve done a pretty good job, that we haven’t, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it ENDEND 
But what is certainly true is that the American people  just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world  are seeing extraordinarily rapid change ENDEND  The world is shrinking ENDEND  Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting ENDEND  Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct ENDEND  People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security ENDEND  They’re looking for some means of control ENDEND 
And what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe, or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries ENDEND 
And I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase ENDEND  But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles, as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them but also change governments if they're not serving them well  then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue ENDEND 
And I think it’s especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it’s particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries  those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization  and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways ENDEND 
And I think that can be done ENDEND  But it’s hard ENDEND  It requires creativity ENDEND  It requires effective communications ENDEND  Part of what’s changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information ENDEND  It’s easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies ENDEND  But we’ll figure it out ENDEND 
So, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America’s future, but the direction that the world is going in ENDEND  And part of what makes me most optimistic is if you look at the attitudes of young people ENDEND  Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences ENDEND  They are much more comfortable with diversity ENDEND  They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between “us” and “them ENDEND ” They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully, and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders ENDEND 
So that's where the future is ENDEND  But we have to create that bridge to the future ENDEND  And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped get us here ENDEND  And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine ENDEND 
Chancellor Merkel:  On the issue first of independence of Germany, after the time of national socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America ENDEND  The fact that we were able to enjoy German unification is due first and foremost to the help of the United States of America ENDEND  And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed, and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country ENDEND 
Now, we're trying to do more than it used to be  years ago ENDEND  And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution ENDEND  We will all have to do more in development cooperation ENDEND  It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked ENDEND  Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate  which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union ENDEND  We cannot stand alone with  million people ENDEND  In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much  even though you may be economically strong ENDEND  So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation ENDEND  And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole ENDEND 
Secondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at  and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States ENDEND  Look at the European Parliament ENDEND  There are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, who are sort of preaching policies of  well, very unfriendly policies ENDEND  We have them here in Europe, too ENDEND  We have them here in Germany, too ENDEND 
And to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deepseated change, transformation of a society ENDEND  Look at the history of the printing press  when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had ENDEND  Or industrialization  what sort of consequences that had ENDEND  Very often it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this ENDEND  And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a translation from agricultural societies to industrial societies ENDEND 
Now, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country ENDEND  We have it in other countries ENDEND  Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days  trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place ENDEND 
But those that belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others  that is something that we cannot allow to happen ENDEND  That is something that I think, at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people  that was something that filled me with great joy ENDEND  But the fact that this people have hijacked it is not something that fills me with great joy ENDEND  We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people ENDEND  But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so ENDEND 
Now, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard ENDEND  If you've worked together with somebody very well, leavetaking is very difficult ENDEND  But we are politicians ENDEND  We all know that democracy lives off change ENDEND  So in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this ENDEND  It's a tough rule  eight years and that's it ENDEND  Out goes the President and a new one comes in ENDEND  So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead ENDEND  But personal  we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game ENDEND  So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say ENDEND 
I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump ENDEND  And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks ENDEND 
Lastly, sir, in these final weeks of your presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar alAssad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?
Chancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar alAssad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally ENDEND  Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate ENDEND  I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem?
 One of the great things about our democracy is it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting ENDEND  I've been the subject of protests during the course of my eight years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests ENDEND  So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign  I wouldn't advise them to be silent ENDEND 
What I would advise  what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election  is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter ENDEND  And what I consistently say to young people  I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe  do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life ENDEND 
I think there is a tendency  because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up  there is a tendency I think to assume that that's always the case ENDEND  And it's not ENDEND  Democracy is hard work ENDEND 
In the United States, if  percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened ENDEND  If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not  and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones  if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems ENDEND  If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process, and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down ENDEND 
And so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there’s an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks ENDEND 
It’s hard work ENDEND  And the good news is I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward ENDEND 
But I do think sometimes there’s complacency ENDEND  Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the Cold War, who forget what it meant to have a wall ENDEND  And I’ll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where and easily equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia, and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate  where those distinctions aren’t made ENDEND 
I’ve said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws, we’ve operated imperfectly ENDEND  There are times when we’ve made mistakes ENDEND  There are times where I’ve made mistakes, or our Administration hasn’t always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with ENDEND  It’s a work of constant improvement ENDEND 
But I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany ENDEND  And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties, and an independent judiciary, and fighting corruption  those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country but also with respect to our foreign policy ENDEND 
And that should be remembered ENDEND  Because in an age where there’s so much active misinformation  and it’s packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television  where some overzealousness on the part of a United States   official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere  if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won’t know what to protect ENDEND  We won’t know what to fight for ENDEND  And we can lose so much of what we’ve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and marketbased economies and prosperity that we’ve come to take for granted ENDEND 
That was a long answer, wasn’t it? I don’t remember if there was a second part to it ENDEND  I got all caught up in that one ENDEND 
Question: I asked you if you advised the Presidentelect on things 
 Yes, I did ENDEND  I did ENDEND  He ran a extraordinarily unconventional campaign, and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history  American history ENDEND  And that means that he now has to transition to governance ENDEND  And what I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn’t support him ENDEND 
And he’s indicated his willingness to  his understanding of that ENDEND  But you’re absolutely right that that has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his Administration ENDEND  And my hope is, is that that’s something he is thinking about, because not only is the President of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways ENDEND 
Question: And Syria?
 With respect to Syria, we are going to continue to work, as we have over the last five, six years, to push towards a political transition and settlement ENDEND 
It would be naïve of me to suggest that with Russia committed militarily as it is to supporting what, in many cases, are barbarous tactics by the Assad regime to crush the opposition, the sort of indiscriminate bombing that we’ve been seeing not just in Aleppo but in many parts of the country over the last several years  it would be naïve of me to suggest that there’s going to be a sudden, degree turn in policy by either Assad or Russia or Iran at this point ENDEND  But we are going to continue to make the argument ENDEND  We are going to continue to try to find humanitarian steps that can reach the people there ENDEND  We’re going to continue to try to obtain Cessations of Hostilities that lessen the human tragedy and the migration that’s taking place ENDEND 
But, ultimately, the way this is going to be resolved is going to have to be a recognition by Russia, and a willingness to pressure Assad that a lasting, durable peace with a functioning country requires the consent of people ENDEND  You cannot purchase people’s consent through killing them ENDEND  They haven’t made that transition yet, but we’re going to keep on trying ENDEND 
Chancellor Merkel:  I think I can speak for the whole of the federal government when I say that we are no longer in election mode in the United States, we’re in postelection mode ENDEND  There is an interest of the Federal Republic of Germany to cooperate well with the United States of America ENDEND  This goes for each and every President on the basis of shared values, and I believe that these are, indeed, shared values, and should be shared values ENDEND 
So as to my position on President Assad, Assad as President has actively tried to kill his own people ENDEND  He has bombed them with barrel bombs in a most terrible way ENDEND  He has brought untold suffering over his people  if you look at Aleppo and other places ENDEND  When you talk to the many Syrian refugees who have fled here to Germany, they will be able to tell you their own personal story, and the majority of them  the great majority of them  fled from Assad, and most of them not even fled the IS ENDEND  So I don’t see him as an ally ENDEND 
Question: Thank you very much ENDEND Let me break this down to months and years ENDEND  The fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist, meeting Mr. Farage, and the fact that prominent Republican representatives did not decide to join this transition team  what makes you confident, against the background of this, that President Trump can be a reliable partner to the world and to Europe and Germany?
Now, Madam Chancellor, if you hear those words of praise of the President with regard to you  this, what he said, can this not sort of demand too much from you and from Germany? Because too much is demanded, too much is expected from you  too great are the expectations, you can’t meet them?
 I’m always optimistic ENDEND  There were times where I was in the Oval Office and people would come to me with all kinds of political problems and policy problems and international problems, and my team would be getting discouraged and depressed, and I would say to them, I have to be optimistic, because the odds of somebody named Barack Obama being President of the United States were very low, and the fact that, in my lifetime, I have seen such enormous, positive change in the United States and around the world tells me that, although history does not travel in a straight line, it moves in the direction of justice and freedom and a better life for people ENDEND  But we have to fight for it ENDEND  We have to work for it ENDEND 
What makes me cautiously optimistic about my successor and the shift from campaign mode to governance is there’s something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States  not just by its own people but by people around the world  that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness ENDEND  And if you’re not serious about the job, then you probably won’t be there very long because it will expose problems ENDEND 
Even when you’re doing a job, even when you are attentive, there are so many things that come across your desk that people are going to question you, and you’re going to have opponents and you’re going to have critics, and you figure that out pretty fast when you’re sitting there ENDEND  And I think the Presidentelect is going to see fairly quickly that the demands and responsibilities of a United States   President are not ones that you can treat casually, and that in a big, complex, diverse country, the only way that you can be successful is by listening and reaching out and working with a wide variety of people ENDEND 
And so it is my hope that that is what will happen ENDEND  And I’m going to do everything I can over the next two months to help assure that that happens ENDEND 
It is absolutely true that Chancellor Merkel is going to have significant responsibilities, has had extraordinary burdens that she’s had to carry ENDEND  If she chooses to continue, you're right, she will have big burdens ENDEND  I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she’s tough ENDEND  And I have  I know what it means to carry burdens because the fact of the matter is, is that if there are problems around the world, the first question people ask is, why isn’t Washington doing something about it?
This is why it’s so important not to discount or take for granted the importance of the Transatlantic Alliance ENDEND  And this is probably the best place for me to end ENDEND 
In international for a  in Gs, in Gs, in the United Nations  the United States and Germany are not always perfectly aligned ENDEND  America and Europe are not always perfectly aligned ENDEND  But the voice that speaks out on behalf of some dissident who is jailed halfway around the world, the voice who is expressing concern about some child in an African village who doesn't have clean drinking water or is subject to some terrible disease, the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible  that's our voice more often than not ENDEND 
And we're not always successful ENDEND  But if that voice is absent, or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world ENDEND  And we have to remember that ENDEND  And whoever is the United States   President, and whoever is the Chancellor of Germany, and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world  they need to recognize that ENDEND 
There are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else’s problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable because sometimes that's politically convenient ENDEND  And if we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world ENDEND  We will go backwards instead of forwards ENDEND 
So whoever the United States   President is, whoever the Chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that ENDEND  And our citizenry who decide who our Presidents and Chancellors are need to remember that ENDEND 
Chancellor Merkel:  It is, after all, a very good thing if, after eight years of cooperation, the President of the United States says that this is a cooperation based on friendship, that we cooperated well ENDEND  I feel that this is a very good, a very positive message, and, indeed, an encouragement for me ENDEND 
Now, secondly, I, fortunately, know very many people  and there are many, many more that I don't know, and many politicians  who stand up for the same values of democracy, of liberal societies, of open societies, of respect for the dignity of man ENDEND  And I feel that we are in a community of people here who stand up for these values, who try to maintain them, and wherever they are not yet respected, stand up for people’s rights to enjoy them, as well ENDEND 
And this is worth every effort ENDEND  But I think we're gratified to know that there are many, many people who feel committed to this goal ENDEND 
Thank you very much ENDEND 

Hello, Greece Yia sas Kalispera  To the government and the people of Greece  including Prime Minister Tsipras, who I thank for his partnership and for being here, along with so many young people, the future of Greece  I want to thank you for your warm and generous welcome ENDEND 
As many of you know, this is my final trip overseas as President of the United States, and I was determined, on my last trip, to come to Greece  partly because I’ve heard about the legendary hospitality of the Greek people  your philoxenia ENDEND  Partly because I had to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon ENDEND  But also because I came here with gratitude for all that Greece  “this small, great world”  has given to humanity through the ages ENDEND 
Our hearts have been moved by the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides ENDEND  Our minds have been opened by the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides ENDEND  Our understanding of the world and our place in it has been expanded by Socrates and Aristotle ENDEND 
In the United States, we’re especially grateful for the friendship of so many proud Greek Americans ENDEND  In my hometown of Chicago  you can find them in Greektown, with their fustanellas ENDEND  And together, we’ve celebrated Greek Independence Day at the White House ENDEND  We’ve had some spanakopita and some ouzo ENDEND  Greek Americans have worn the uniform to keep our country free ENDEND  Greek Americans have marched with Dr ENDEND  Martin Luther King, Jr ENDEND  to make us more just ENDEND  Greek or American, we’re all cheering for Giannis Antetokounmpo  who seems to be getting better each year ENDEND  And if anyone seeks an example of our shared spirit, our resilience, they need look no further than New York City, near Ground Zero, where the Greek Orthodox Church of St ENDEND  Nicholas, once in ruins, is now rising again ENDEND 
Most of all, we’re indebted to Greece for the most precious of gifts  the truth, the understanding that as individuals of free will, we have the right and the capacity to govern ourselves ENDEND  For it was here,  centuries ago, in the rocky hills of this city, that a new idea emerged ENDEND  Demokratia ENDEND  Kratos  the power, the right to rule  comes from demos  the people ENDEND  The notion that we are citizens  not servants, but stewards of our society ENDEND  The concept of citizenship  that we have both rights and responsibilities ENDEND  The belief in equality before the law  not just for a few, but for the many; not just for the majority, but also the minority ENDEND  These are all concepts that grew out of this rocky soil ENDEND 
Of course, the earliest forms of democracy here in Athens were far from perfect  just as the early forms of democracy in the United States were far from perfect ENDEND  The rights of ancient Athens were not extended to women or to slaves ENDEND  But Pericles explained, “our constitution favors the many instead of the few…this is why it is called a democracy ENDEND ”
Athenians also knew that, however noble, ideas alone were not enough ENDEND  To have meaning, principles must be enshrined in laws and protected by institutions, and advanced through civic participation ENDEND  And so they gathered in a great assembly to debate and decide affairs of state, each citizen with the right to speak, casting their vote with a show of hands, or choosing a pebble  white for yes, black for no ENDEND  Laws were etched in stone for all to see and abide by ENDEND  Courts, with citizen jurors, upheld that rule of law ENDEND 
Politicians weren’t always happy because sometimes the stones could be used to ostracize, banish those who did not behave themselves ENDEND 
But across the millennia that followed, different views of power and governance have often prevailed ENDEND  Throughout human history, there have been those who argue that people cannot handle democracy, that they cannot handle selfdetermination, they need to be told what to do ENDEND  A ruler has to maintain order through violence or coercion or an iron fist ENDEND  There’s been a different concept of government that says might makes right, or that unchecked power can be passed through bloodlines ENDEND  There’s been the belief that some are superior by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, and those beliefs so often have been used to justify conquest and exploitation and war ENDEND 
But through all this history, the flame first lit here in Athens never died ENDEND  It was ultimately nurtured by a great Enlightenment ENDEND  It was fanned by America’s founders, who declared that “We, the People” shall rule; "that all men are created equal" and "endowed by  Creator with certain inalienable rights ENDEND "
Now, at times, even today, those ideals are challenged ENDEND  We’ve been told that these are Western ideals ENDEND  We’ve been told that some cultures are not equipped for democratic governance and actually prefer authoritarian rule ENDEND  And I will say that after eight years of being President of the United States, having traveled around the globe, it is absolutely true that every country travels its own path; every country has its own traditions ENDEND  But what I also believe, after eight years, is that the basic longing to live with dignity, the fundamental desire to have control of our lives and our future, and to want to be a part of determining the course of our communities and our nations  these yearnings are universal ENDEND  They burn in every human heart ENDEND 
It’s why a Greek bishop atop a mountain raised the flag of independence ENDEND  It’s why peoples from the Americas to Africa to Asia threw off the yoke of colonialism ENDEND  It’s why people behind an Iron Curtain marched in Solidarity, and tore down that wall, and joined you in a great union of democracies ENDEND  It’s why, today, we support the right of Ukrainians to choose their own destiny; why we partner with Tunisians and the people of Myanmar as they make historic transitions to democracy ENDEND 
This has been my foreign policy during my presidency ENDEND  By necessity, we work with all countries, and many of them are not democracies ENDEND  Some of them are democracies in the sense they have elections, but not democracies in the sense of actually permitting participation and dissent ENDEND  But our trajectory as a country has been to support the efforts of those who believe in selfgovernance, who believe in those ideas that began here so many years ago ENDEND 
And it is not simply a matter of us being true to our values ENDEND  It’s not just a matter of idealism ENDEND  I believe it is practical for the United States to support democracies ENDEND  Because history shows us that countries with democratic governance tend to be more just, and more stable, and more successful ENDEND 
Open, democratic societies can deliver more prosperity because when people are free to think for themselves and share ideas and discover and create  the young people who are here, what they’re able to do through the Internet and technology, that’s when innovation is unleashed, when economies truly flourish ENDEND  That’s when new products, and new services, and new ideas wash through an economy ENDEND  In contrast to regimes that rule by coercion, democracies are rooted in consent of the governed  citizens know that there’s a path for peaceful change, including the moral force of nonviolence ENDEND  And that brings a stability that so often can facilitate economic growth ENDEND 
The history of the past two centuries indicates that democracies are less likely to fight wars among themselves ENDEND  So more democracy is good for the people of the world, but it’s also good for our national security ENDEND  Which is why America’s closest friends are democracies  like Greece ENDEND  It’s why we stand together in NATO  an alliance of democracies ENDEND 
In recent years, we’ve made historic investments in NATO, increased America’s presence in Europe, and today’s NATO  the world’s greatest alliance  is as strong and as ready as it’s ever been ENDEND  And I am confident that just as America’s commitment to the transatlantic alliance has endured for seven decades whether it’s been under a Democratic or Republican Administration  that commitment will continue, including our pledge and our treaty obligation to defend every ally ENDEND 
Our democracies show that we’re stronger than terrorists, and fundamentalists, and absolutists who can’t tolerate difference, can’t tolerate ideas that vary from their own, who try to change people’s way of life through violence and would make us betray or shrink from our values ENDEND  Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIL ENDEND 
Because our democracies are inclusive, we’re able to welcome people and refugees in need to our countries ENDEND  And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece ENDEND  The Greek people’s generosity towards refugees arriving on your shores has inspired the world ENDEND  That doesn’t mean that you should be left on your own  and only a truly collective response by Europe and the world can ensure that these desperate people receive the support that they need ENDEND  Greece cannot be expected to bear the bulk of the burden alone  but the fact that your democracy opens your heart to people in need in a way that might not otherwise be the case ENDEND 
Just as democracies are premised on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within our societies, we also believe that cooperation and dialogue is the best way to address challenges between nations ENDEND  And so it is my belief that democracies are more likely to try to resolve conflicts between nations in a way that does not result in war ENDEND  That’s how, with diplomacy, we were able to shut down Iran’s nuclear weapons program without firing a shot ENDEND  With diplomacy, the United States opened relations with Cuba ENDEND  With diplomacy, we joined Greece and nearly  nations in the most ambitious agreement ever to save our planet from climate change ENDEND 
And speaking of climate change, I would point out that there is a connection between democracy and science ENDEND  The premise of science is that we observe and we test our hypotheses, our ideas ENDEND  We base decisions on facts, not superstition; not what our ideology tells us, but rather what we can observe ENDEND  And at a time when the globe is shrinking and more and more we’re going to have to take collective action to deal with problems like climate change, the presence of a democratic debate allows the science to flourish and to shape our collective responses ENDEND 
Now, democracy, like all human institutions, is imperfect ENDEND  It can be slow; it can be frustrating; it can be hard; it can be messy ENDEND  Politicians tend to be unpopular in democracies, regardless of party, because, by definition, democracies require that you don’t get a hundred percent of what you want ENDEND  It requires compromise ENDEND  Winston Churchill famously said "that democracy is the worst form of government"  except for all the others ENDEND  And in a multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural society, like the United States, democracy can be especially complicated ENDEND  Believe me, I know ENDEND 
But it is better than the alternatives because it allows us to peacefully work through our differences and move closer to our ideals ENDEND  It allows us to test new ideas and it allows us to correct for mistakes ENDEND  Any action by a President, or any result of an election, or any legislation that has proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy ENDEND 
And throughout our history, it’s how we have come to see that all people are created equal  even though, when we were founded, that was not the case ENDEND  We could work to expand the rights that were established in our founding to African Americans, and to women, to Americans with disabilities, to Native Americans; why all Americans now have the freedom to marry the person they love ENDEND  It’s why we welcome people of all races and all religions and all backgrounds, and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life and who make our country stronger ENDEND 
And so here, where democracy was born, we affirm once more the rights and the ideals and the institutions upon which our way of life endures: freedom of speech and assembly  because true legitimacy can only come from the people, who must never be silenced; a free press to expose injustice and corruption and hold leaders accountable; freedom of religion  because we’re all equal in the eyes of God; independent judiciaries to uphold rule of law and human rights; separation of powers to limit the reach of any one branch of government; free and fair elections  because citizens must be able to choose their own leaders, even if your candidate doesn’t always win ENDEND 
We compete hard in campaigns in America and here in Greece ENDEND  But after the election, democracy depends on a peaceful transition of power, especially when you don’t get the result you want ENDEND 
And as you may have noticed, the next American President and I could not be more different ENDEND  We have very different points of view, but American democracy is bigger than any one person ENDEND  That’s why we have a tradition of the outgoing President welcoming the new one in  as I did last week ENDEND  And why, in the coming weeks, my Administration will do everything we can to support the smoothest transition possible  because that’s how democracy has to work ENDEND 
And that’s why, as hard as it can be sometimes, it’s important for young people, in particular, who are just now becoming involved in the lives of their countries, to understand that progress follows a winding path  sometimes forward, sometimes back  but as long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don’t waver from those central principles that ensure a lively, open debate, then our future will be okay, because it remains the most effective form of government ever devised by man ENDEND 
It is true, of course, over the last several years that we’ve seen democracies faced with serious challenges ENDEND  And I want to mention two that have an impact here in Greece, haven an impact in the United States, and are having an impact around the world ENDEND 
The first involves the paradox of a modern, global economy ENDEND  The same forces of globalization and technology and integration that have delivered so much progress, have created so much wealth, have also revealed deep fault lines ENDEND  Around the world, integration and closer cooperation, and greater trade and commerce, and the Internet  all have improved the lives of billions of people  lifted families from extreme poverty, cured diseases, helped people live longer, gave them more access to education and opportunity than at any time in human history ENDEND 
I’ve often said to young people in the United States, if you had to choose a moment in history to be born, and you did not know ahead of time who you would be  you didn’t know whether you were going to be born into a wealthy family or a poor family, what country you’d be born, whether you were going to be a man or a woman  if you had to choose blindly what moment you’d want to be born: You’d choose now ENDEND  Because the world has never, collectively, been wealthier, better educated, healthier, less violent than it is today ENDEND  That’s hard to imagine, given what we see in the news, but it’s true ENDEND  And a lot of that has to do with the developments of a integrated, global economy ENDEND 
But trends underway for decades have meant that in many countries and in many communities there have been enormous disruptions ENDEND  Technology and automation mean that goods can be produced with fewer workers ENDEND  It means jobs and manufacturing can move across borders where wages are lower or rights are less protected ENDEND  And that means that workers and unions oftentimes have less leverage to bargain for better wages, better benefits, have more difficulty competing in the global marketplace ENDEND  Hardworking families worry their kids may not be better off than they were because of this global competition ENDEND 
What we’ve also seen is that this global integration is increasing the tendencies towards inequality, both between nations and within nations, at an accelerated pace ENDEND  And when we see people  global elites, wealthy corporations  seemingly living by a different set of rules, avoiding taxes, manipulating loopholes  when the rich and the powerful appear to game the system and accumulate vast wealth while middle and workingclass families struggle to make ends meet, this feeds a profound sense of injustice and a feeling that our economies are increasingly unfair ENDEND 
This inequality now constitutes one of the greatest challenges to our economies and to our democracies ENDEND  An inequality that was once tolerated because people didn’t know how unequal things were now won’t be tolerated because everybody has a cellphone and can see how unequal things are ENDEND  The awareness that people have in the smallest African village, they can see how people in London or New York are living ENDEND  The poorest child in any of our countries now has a sense of what other people have that they don’t ENDEND  So not only is there increasing inequality, but also there is greater awareness of inequality ENDEND  And that’s a volatile mix for our democracies ENDEND 
And this is why addressing inequality has been one of the key areas of focus for my economic policy ENDEND  In our countries, in America and in most advanced market economies, we want people to be rewarded for their achievement ENDEND  We think that people should be rewarded if they come up with a new product or a new service that is popular and helps a lot of people ENDEND  But when a CEO of a company now makes more money in a single day than a typical worker does in an entire year, when it’s harder for workers to climb their way up the economic ladder, when they see a factory close that used to support an entire city or town, fuels the feeling that globalization only benefits those at the top ENDEND  And the reaction can drag down a country’s growth and make recessions more likely ENDEND  It can also lead to politics that create an unhealthy competition between countries ENDEND  Rather than a winwin situation, people perceive that if you’re winning, I’m losing, and barriers come up and walls come up ENDEND 
And in advanced economies, there are at times movements from both the left and the right to put a stop to integration, and to push back against technology, and to try to bring back jobs and industries that have been disappearing for decades ENDEND  So this impulse to pull back from a globalized world is understandable ENDEND  If people feel that they’re losing control of their future, they will push back ENDEND  We have seen it here in Greece ENDEND  We’ve seen it across Europe ENDEND  We’ve seen it in the United States ENDEND  We saw it in the vote in Britain to leave the EU ENDEND 
But given the nature of technology, it is my assertion that it’s not possible to cut ourselves off from one another ENDEND  We now are living in a global supply chain ENDEND  Our growth comes through innovation and ideas that are crossing borders all the time ENDEND  The jobs of tomorrow will inevitably be different from the jobs of the past ENDEND  So we can’t look backwards for answers, we have to look forward ENDEND 
We cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress and so much wealth ENDEND  For when competition for resources is perceived as zerosum, we put ourselves on a path to conflict both within countries and between countries ENDEND  So I firmly believe that the best hope for human progress remains open markets combined with democracy and human rights ENDEND  But I have argued that the current path of globalization demands a course correction ENDEND  In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people, and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed ENDEND 
And we actually know the path to building more inclusive economies ENDEND  It’s just we too often don’t have the political will or desire to get it done ENDEND  We know we need bold policies that spur growth and support jobs ENDEND  We know that we need to give workers more leverage and better wages, and that, in fact, if you give workers better wages businesses do better, too, because their customers now have money to spend ENDEND 
We know that we have to invest more in our people  the education of our young people, the skills and training to compete in the global economy ENDEND  We have to make sure that it is easy for young people who are eager to learn and eager to work to get the education that they need, the training that they need, without taking on huge amounts of debt ENDEND 
We know that we have to encourage entrepreneurship so that it’s easier to start a business and do business ENDEND  We know that we have to strengthen the social compact so that the safety net that is available for people, including quality health care and retirement benefits, are there even if people aren’t working in the same job for  years, or  years, or  years ENDEND 
We have to modernize our infrastructure, which will put people back to work ENDEND  We have to commit to the science and research and development that sparks new industries ENDEND 
In our trading relationships, we have to make sure that trade works for us, and not against us ENDEND  And that means insisting on high standards in all countries to support jobs, strong protections for workers, strong protections for the environment, so that even as we freely trade, people and workers in all countries see the benefits of trade in their own lives, not just benefits for the bottom line of large, multinational corporations ENDEND 
These are the kinds of policies, this is the work that I’ve pursued throughout my time as President ENDEND  Keep in mind I took office in the midst of the worst crisis since the Great Depression ENDEND  And we pursued a recovery that has been shared now by the vast majority of Americans ENDEND  We put people back to work building bridges and roads ENDEND  We passed tax cuts for the middle class ENDEND  We asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more taxes  their fair share ENDEND  We intervened to save our auto industry, but insisted that the auto industry become more energy efficient, produce better cars that reduce pollution ENDEND 
We put in place policies to help students with loans and protect consumers from fraud ENDEND  We passed the strongest Wall Street reforms in history so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the global financial crisis never happen again  or at least don’t start on Wall Street ENDEND 
And today, our businesses have created more than  million new jobs ENDEND  Incomes last year in America rose faster than any time since  ENDEND  Poverty fell at the fastest rate since  ENDEND  Inequality is being narrowed ENDEND  And we’ve also begun to close the pay gap between men and women ENDEND 
We declared that health care in America is a privilege not for the few, but a right for everybody ENDEND  Today our uninsured rate is at the lowest levels on record ENDEND  And we’ve done all this while doubling our production of clean energy, lowering our carbon pollution faster than any advanced nation ENDEND  So we’ve proven that you can grow the economy and reduce the carbon emissions that cause climate change at the same time ENDEND 
Now, I say all this not because we’ve solved every problem ENDEND  Our work is far from complete ENDEND  There are still too many people in America who are worried about their futures ENDEND  Still too many people who are working at wages that don’t get them above the poverty line ENDEND  Still too many young people who don’t see opportunity ENDEND  But the policies I describe point the direction for where we need to go in building inclusive economies ENDEND  And that’s how democracies can deliver the prosperity and hope that our people need ENDEND  And when people have opportunity and they feel confidence the future, they are less likely to turn on each other and they’re less likely to appeal to some of the darker forces that exist in all our societies  those that can tear us apart ENDEND 
Here in Greece, you’re undergoing similar transformations ENDEND  The first step has been to build a foundation that allows you to return to robust economic growth ENDEND  And we don’t need to recount all the causes of the economic crisis here in Greece ENDEND  If we’re honest, we can acknowledge that it was a mix of both internal and external forces ENDEND  The Greek economy and the level of debt had become unsustainable ENDEND  And in this global economy, investment and jobs flow to countries where governments are efficient, not bloated, where the rules are clear ENDEND  To stay competitive, to attract investment that creates jobs, Greece had to start a reform process ENDEND 
Of course, the world, I don’t think, fully appreciates the extraordinary pain these reforms have involved, or the tremendous sacrifices that you, the Greek people, have made ENDEND  I’ve been aware of it, and I’ve been proud of all that my Administration has done to try to support Greece in these efforts ENDEND  And part of the purpose of my visit is to highlight for the world the important steps that have been taken here in Greece ENDEND 
Today, the budget is back in surplus ENDEND  Parliament passed reforms to make the economy more competitive ENDEND  Yes, there is still much more work to do ENDEND  I want to commend Prime Minister Tsipras for the very difficult reforms his government is pursuing to put the economy on a firmer footing ENDEND  Now, as Greece works to attract more investment, and to prevent old imbalances from reemerging, and to put your economy on a stronger foundation, you’ll continue to have the full support of the United States ENDEND 
At the same time, I will continue to urge creditors to take the steps needed to put Greece on a path towards sustained economic recovery ENDEND  As Greece continues to implement reforms, the IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth ENDEND  They are right ENDEND  It is important because if reforms here are going to be sustained, people need to see hope, and they need to see progress ENDEND  And the young people who are in attendance here today and all across the country need to know there is a future  there is an education and jobs that are worthy of your incredible potential ENDEND  You don’t have to travel overseas, you can put roots right here in your home, in Greece, and succeed ENDEND 
And I’m confident that if you stay the course, as hard as it has been, Greece will see brighter days ENDEND  Because, in this magnificent hall and center  this symbol of the Greek culture and resilience  we’re reminded that just as your strength and resolve have allowed you to overcome great odds throughout your history, nothing can break the spirit of the Greek people ENDEND  You will overcome this period of challenge just as you have other challenges in the past ENDEND 
So economics is something that will be central to preserving our democracies ENDEND  When our economies don’t work, our democracies become distorted and, in some cases, break down ENDEND  But this brings me to another pressing challenge that our democracies face  how do we ensure that our diverse, multicultural, multiracial, multireligious world and our diverse nations uphold both the rights of individuals and a fundamental civic adherence to a common creed that binds us together ENDEND 
Democracy is simplest where everybody thinks alike, looks alike, eats the same food, worships the same God ENDEND  Democracy becomes more difficult when there are people coming from a variety of backgrounds and trying to live together ENDEND  In our globalized world, with the migration of people and the rapid movement of ideas and cultures and traditions, we see increasingly this blend of forces mixing together in ways that often enrich our societies but also cause tensions ENDEND 
In the Information Age, the unprecedented exchange of information can always accentuate differences, or seem to threaten cherished ways of life ENDEND  It used to be that you might not know how people in another part of your country, or in the cities versus the countryside, were living ENDEND  Now everybody knows how everybody is living, and everybody can feel threatened sometimes if people don’t do things exactly the way they do things ENDEND  And they start asking themselves questions about their own identity ENDEND  And it can create a volatile politics ENDEND 
Faced with this new reality where cultures clash, it's inevitable that some will seek a comfort in nationalism or tribe or ethnicity or sect ENDEND  In countries that are held together by borders that were drawn by colonial powers, including many countries in the Middle East and in Africa, it can be tempting to fall back on perceived safety of enclaves and tribal divisions ENDEND 
In a world of widening inequality, there's a growing suspicion  or even disdain  for elites and institutions that seem remote from the daily lives of ordinary people ENDEND  What an irony it is, at a time when we can reach out to people in the most remote corners of the planet, so many citizens feel disconnected from their own governments ENDEND 
So, just as we have to have an inclusive economic strategy, we have to have an exclusive political and cultural strategy ENDEND  In all of our capitals, we have to keep making government more efficient, more effective in responding to the daily needs to citizens ENDEND  Governing institutions, whether in Athens, Brussels, London, Washington, have to be responsive to the concerns of citizens ENDEND  People have to know that they're being heard ENDEND 
Here in Europe, even with today's challenges, I believe that by virtue of the progress it has delivered over the decades  the stability it has provided, the security it's reinforced  that European integration and the European Union remains one of the great political and economic achievements of human history ENDEND  And today more than ever, the world needs a Europe that is strong and prosperous and democratic ENDEND 
But I think all institutions in Europe have to ask themselves: How can we make sure that people within individual countries feel as if their voices are still being heard, that their identities are being affirmed, that the decisions that are being made that will have a critical impact on their lives are not so remote that they have no ability to impact them?
We have to make clear that governments exist to serve the interest of citizens, and not the other way around ENDEND  And so this is why, as President of the United States, I've pursued initiatives like the Open Government Partnership that promotes transparency and accountability so that ordinary people know more about the decisions that affect their lives ENDEND  That's why both at home and around the world, we have taken steps to fight corruption that can rot a society from within ENDEND 
As authoritarian governments work to close space that citizens depend upon to organize and have their voices heard, we've begun the work of empowering civil society to defend democratic values and promote solutions to the problems within our communities ENDEND  And as so many people around the world sometimes are tempted by cynicism and not being involved because they think that politicians and government don’t care about them, we've created networks for young leaders and invested in young entrepreneurs, because we believe that the hope and renewal of our societies begins with the voices of youth ENDEND 
In closing, our globalized world is passing through a time of profound change ENDEND  Yes, there is uncertainty and there is unease, and none of us can know the future ENDEND  History does not move in a straight line ENDEND  Civil rights in America did not move in a straight line ENDEND  Democracy in Greece did not move in a straight line ENDEND  The evolution of a unified Europe certainly has not moved in a straight line ENDEND  And progress is never a guarantee ENDEND  Progress has to be earned by every generation ENDEND  But I believe history gives us hope ENDEND 
Twentyfive centuries after Athens first pointed the way,  years after the beginning of the great American journey, my faith and my confidence, my certainty in our democratic ideals and universal values remain undiminished ENDEND  I believe more strongly than ever that Dr ENDEND  King was right when he said that, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice ENDEND ” But it bends towards justice not because it is inevitable, but because we bend it towards justice; not because there are not going to be barriers to achieving justice, but because there will be people, generation after generation, who have the vision and the courage and the will to bend the arc of our lives in the direction of a better future ENDEND 
In the United States, and in every place I have visited these last eight years, I have met citizens, especially young people, who have chosen hope over fear, who believe that they can shape their own destiny, who refuse to accept the world as it is and are determined to remake it as it should be ENDEND  They have inspired me ENDEND 
In every corner of the world, I have met people who, in their daily lives, demonstrate that despite differences of race or religion or creed or color, we have the capacity to see each other in ourselves ENDEND  Like the woman here in Greece who said of the refugees arriving on these shores, "We live under the same sun ENDEND  We fall in love under the same moon ENDEND  We are all human  we have to help these people ENDEND " Women like that give me hope ENDEND 
In all of our communities, in all of our countries, I still believe there's more of what Greeks call philotimo  love and respect and kindness for family and community and country, and a sense that we’re all in this together, with obligations to each other ENDEND  Philotimo  I see it every day  and that gives me hope ENDEND 
Because in the end, it is up to us ENDEND  It's not somebody else's job, it's not somebody else's responsibility, but it's the citizens of our countries and citizens of the world to bend that arc of history towards justice ENDEND 
And that’s what democracy allows us to do ENDEND  That's why the most important office in any country is not President or Prime Minister ENDEND  The most important title is “citizen ENDEND ” And in all of our nations, it will always be our citizens who decide the kind of countries we will be, the ideals that we will reach for, and the values that will define us ENDEND  In this great, imperfect, but necessary system of selfgovernment, power and progress will always come from the demos  from “We, the people ENDEND ” And I'm confident that as long as we are true to that system of selfgovernment, that our futures will be bright ENDEND 
Thank you very much ENDEND  Zito e ellas ENDEND  
 The quotation wad delivered during remarks before the ouse of Commons on  November : Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe ENDEND  No one pretends that democracy is perfect or allwise ENDEND  Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time; but there is the broad feeling in our country that the people should rule, continuously rule, and that public opinion, expressed by all constitutional means, should shape, guide, and control the actions of Ministers who are their servants and not their masters ENDEND  


Hello, everybody ENDEND  Hello, hello ENDEND 
Hello, everybody ENDEND  In a couple hours, I’ll be departing on my final foreign trip as President ENDEND  And while we’re abroad, I’ll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait? I know that there’s a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas, and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them ENDEND 
Let me  I know you still will ENDEND  That I'm aware, but I'm trying something out here ENDEND  First of all, let me mention three brief topics ENDEND 
First of all, as I discussed with the Presidentelect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition ENDEND  And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel ENDEND  I remember what it was like when I came in eight years ago ENDEND  It is a big challenge ENDEND  This office is bigger than any one person ENDEND  And that’s why ensuring a smooth transition is so important ENDEND 
It’s not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy  similar to norms of civility and tolerance, and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis ENDEND  It's part of what makes this country work ENDEND  And as long as I’m President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals ENDEND 
As I’ve told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys the car is in pretty good shape ENDEND  We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in eight years ago ENDEND  Jobs have been growing for  straight months ENDEND  Incomes are rising ENDEND  Poverty is falling ENDEND  The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record ENDEND  Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth ENDEND 
And so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape ENDEND  We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January st, America is in the strongest position possible and hopefully there’s an opportunity for the next President to build on that ENDEND 
Number two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy ENDEND  And because there is one President at a time, I’ll spend this week reinforcing America’s support for the approaches that we’ve taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues ENDEND 
I look forward to my first visit in Greece ENDEND  And then, in Germany, I’ll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who’s probably been my closest international partner these past eight years ENDEND  I’ll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies, and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe ENDEND  It’s essential to our national security and it's essential to global stability ENDEND  And that’s why the Transatlantic Alliance and the NATO Alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican Administrations ENDEND 
Finally, in Peru, I’ll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia Pacific ENDEND  This is a time of great change in the world ENDEND  But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe ENDEND  And that’s what it must continue to be ENDEND 
Finally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill’s family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing ENDEND  Gwen was a friend of ours ENDEND  She was an extraordinary journalist ENDEND  She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession  asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work ENDEND 
I always appreciated Gwen’s reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews ENDEND  Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator’s table or at the anchor desk, she not only informed today’s citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow’s journalists ENDEND  She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect  and for whom she blazed a trail as onehalf of the first allfemale anchor team on network news ENDEND 
So Gwen did her country a great service ENDEND  Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today ENDEND 
So, with that, I'm going to take some questions ENDEND  And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal ENDEND 
My understanding is, Colleen, that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City ENDEND 
Question: Correct ENDEND 
 Josh just happens to be from Kansas City ENDEND  So I didn’t know if there was any coincidence there ENDEND  But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors ENDEND 
Question: As it turns out, there’s no place like Kansas City ENDEND 
 There you go ENDEND 
Question: You're about to embark on your final foreign trip ENDEND  What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They’ve expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump ENDEND  Should they be worried about the future of United States   foreign policy? And secondly, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?
 One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the CommanderinChief, the spokesperson for the nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President, it is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries, and our diplomats and other diplomats, and intelligence officers and development workers ENDEND  And there's enormous continuity beneath the daytoday news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world ENDEND  That will continue ENDEND 
In my conversation with the Presidentelect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships ENDEND  And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the Transatlantic Alliance ENDEND  I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship, and a recognition that those alliances aren’t just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world ENDEND 
With respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated and it's hard and it's challenging ENDEND  And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection ENDEND  I think it's important for me not to be bigfooting that conversation ENDEND  I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge ENDEND  That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing ENDEND 
The Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles; The belief that we should an economy that works for everybody, not just a few ENDEND  The belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive ENDEND  That we insist on the dignity and Godgiven potential and worth of every child, regardless of race, or gender, or sexual orientation, or what zip code they were born in ENDEND  That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn’t just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values ENDEND 
So there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn’t be up for debate, should be our North Star ENDEND  But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about ENDEND  I believe that we have better ideas ENDEND  But I also believe that good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them ENDEND  And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere ENDEND  We have to show up everywhere ENDEND  We have to work at a grassroots level  something that's been a running thread in my career ENDEND 
I won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent  days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall ENDEND  And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by  points instead of  points ENDEND  There are some counties maybe I won that people didn’t expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for ENDEND 
And the challenge for a national party is how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for ENDEND  And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press story ENDEND  It’s increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press ENDEND 
And so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up state parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you’re paying attention to, and state rep races and city council races  that all I think will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future ENDEND 
And I’m optimistic that will happen ENDEND  For Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I’ve been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in ; they may not remember me showing up here in  when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset ENDEND  Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally ENDEND  Republicans controlled the Senate and the House ENDEND  And two years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and four years later, I was President of the United States ENDEND 
Things change pretty rapidly ENDEND  But they don’t change inevitably ENDEND  They change because you work for it ENDEND  Nobody said democracy was supposed to be easy ENDEND  This is hard ENDEND  And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard ENDEND 

 About a week ago I started feeling pretty good ENDEND  No, look, I think the learning curve always continues ENDEND  This is a remarkable job ENDEND  It is like no other job on Earth ENDEND  And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues ENDEND  That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world ENDEND 
If you were President  years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a daytoday basis ENDEND  Today, they’re seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing ENDEND  There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today it does ENDEND 
So the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any Administration has to deal with today  and respond to much more rapidly than ever before  that makes it different ENDEND  I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about two weeks before anybody reported on it ENDEND  Imagine that ENDEND  I think it’s fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they’ve got to figure out in about an hour what their response is ENDEND 
So these are the kinds of points that I shared with the Presidentelect ENDEND  It was a freeflowing and, I think, useful conversation ENDEND  I hope it was ENDEND  I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about ENDEND  And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff  particularly your chief of staff, your national security advisor, your White House counsel  how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that ultimately the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that’s something that has to be attended to right away ENDEND 
I have been blessed by having  and I admittedly am biased  some of the smartest, hardestworking, good people in my Administration that I think any President has ever had ENDEND  And as a consequence of that team, I’ve been able to make good decisions ENDEND  And if you don’t have that around you, then you’ll get swamped ENDEND  So I hope that he appreciated that advice ENDEND 
What I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election  all those things are important and should be thought about ENDEND  And I think it’s important to give him the room and the space to do that ENDEND  It takes time to put that together ENDEND 
But I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter ENDEND  And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he’s actually taken office ENDEND 
Question: And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job?
 Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you’ll recall we were losing about , jobs a month ENDEND 
So the good news is that in some ways my experience is atypical ENDEND  It’s hard to find an analogous situation ENDEND  By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years ENDEND  We were in the midst of a free fall ENDEND  The financial system was locking up ENDEND  The auto industry was about to go belly up ENDEND  The housing market had entirely collapsed ENDEND  So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job ENDEND  We just had to make a bunch of decisions ENDEND 
In this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected  otherwise, we wouldn’t have had the results that we had in the election ENDEND  On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it’s been in eight, nine years ENDEND  Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two ENDEND  We've got historically low uninsured rates ENDEND  The financial systems are stable ENDEND  The stock market is hovering around its alltime high, and s have been restored ENDEND  The housing market has recovered ENDEND 
We have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us ENDEND  Our alliances are in strong shape ENDEND  The progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth ENDEND  And gas is two bucks a gallon ENDEND 
So he will have time and space I think to make judicious decisions ENDEND  The incoming Administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires ENDEND  They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve ENDEND  And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last eight years ENDEND  I’m very proud of them for it ENDEND 

And if I can do a compound question, the other one is you mentioned staffing and tone ENDEND  What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments that were expressed by Presidentelect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I’m talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the socalled altright movement, what many call the white nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under President Trump as his chief strategist and senior advisor ENDEND  What message does that send to the country, to the world?
 Athena, without copping out, I think it’s fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the Presidentelect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition ENDEND 
Look, the people have spoken ENDEND  Donald Trump will be the next President, the th President of the United States ENDEND  And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies ENDEND  And those who didn’t vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works ENDEND  That's how this system operates ENDEND 
When I won, there were a number of people who didn’t like me and didn’t like what I stood for ENDEND  And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality ENDEND  Hopefully it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts ENDEND  And so I don’t know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having  percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote ENDEND  But it makes a difference ENDEND 
So given that Presidentelect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him, and members of Congress, and reaching out to constituencies that didn’t vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions ENDEND  And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see, and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in ENDEND 
And my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made ENDEND 
And my advice, as I said, to the Presidentelect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing ENDEND  I think he recognizes that ENDEND  I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward ENDEND  And I don’t think any President ever comes in saying to themselves, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country ENDEND  I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large ENDEND  And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a builtin incentive for him to try to do that ENDEND 
But it's only been six days ENDEND  And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve ENDEND  There are certain things that make for good sound bites but don’t translate into good policy ENDEND  And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with ENDEND 
I did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns, and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity, and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign ENDEND  And I think that's something that he will want to do ENDEND  But this is all happening real fast ENDEND  He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those ENDEND  And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out ENDEND  But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that ENDEND 
Question: And your view of his qualifications ENDEND  Has that changed after meeting with him?
 I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win  he has won ENDEND  He's going to be the next President ENDEND  And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up ENDEND  And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don’t match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself ENDEND 
And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history  those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people ENDEND 

 I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it’s interconnected, that you’re not going to put that genie back in the bottle ENDEND  The American people recognize that their careers, or their kids’ careers are going to have to be more dynamic  that they might not be working at a single plant for  years, but they might have to change careers ENDEND  They might have to get more education ENDEND  They might have to retool or retrain ENDEND 
And I think the American people are game for that ENDEND  They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair ENDEND  And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans’ attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade ENDEND  But they’re concerned about whether or not trade is fair, and whether we’ve got the same access to other countries’ markets as they have with us; is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages, and so forth ENDEND 
Now, I made an argument  thus far, unsuccessfully  that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that, that it strengthened workers’ rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field and, as a consequences, would be good for American workers and American businesses ENDEND  But that’s a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored ENDEND 
So part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described ENDEND  And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair  I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign ENDEND 
As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy ENDEND  It keeps this country young ENDEND  It keeps it dynamic ENDEND  We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks ENDEND  And that’s part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful ENDEND  It’s part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we got a younger population that’s more dynamic ENDEND 
When it comes to trade, I think when you’re governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you’ve got a global supply chain ENDEND  The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they’re bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico ENDEND  And so it’s not as simple as it might have seemed ENDEND 
And the key for us  when I say “us,” I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives  is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real; here’s how we fix them: Higher minimum wage ENDEND  Stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie ENDEND  Stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones ENDEND  Yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren’t engaging in child labor, for example ENDEND  Being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks that are in communities that feel forgotten ENDEND 
That’s going to be our most important strategy ENDEND  And I think we can successfully do that ENDEND  People will still be looking to the United States ENDEND  Our example will still carry great weight ENDEND  And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past ENDEND 
And that didn't surprise me to some degree because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person ENDEND  He’s somebody who I think likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate ENDEND 
And what’s clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxiety, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive ENDEND  And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff ENDEND 
I also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set hardandfast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with ENDEND  I don't think he is ideological ENDEND  I think ultimately he’s pragmatic in that way ENDEND  And that can serve him well, as long as he’s got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction ENDEND 
Do I have concerns? Absolutely ENDEND  Of course, I’ve got concerns ENDEND  He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues ENDEND  But the federal government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it’s an ocean liner  as I discovered when I came into office ENDEND  It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes  even in our first two years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office ENDEND 
And one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he’s really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out ENDEND  I’ll use an obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act ENDEND 
So obviously this has been the Holy Grail for Republicans over the last six, seven years  was “we've got to kill Obamacare ENDEND ” Now, that has been taken as an article of faith  that this is terrible, it doesn’t work and we have to undo it ENDEND 
But now that Republicans are in charge, they got to take a look and say, let's see, we got  million people who have health insurance who didn’t have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefitting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of  everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms ENDEND 
Now, it's one thing to characterize this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction ENDEND  Now, suddenly, you're in charge and you're going to repeal it ENDEND  Okay, well, what happens to those  million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off and suddenly they don’t have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job, and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular ENDEND  How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they're ? How are you going to approach all these issues?
Now, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that  million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first one to say, that's great  congratulations ENDEND 
If, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage, and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem ENDEND  And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way ENDEND 
So I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is now comes the hard part ENDEND  Now is governance ENDEND  We are going to be able to present to the incoming Administration a country that is stronger, a federal government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs ENDEND 
And I think the Presidentelect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse ENDEND  And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick ENDEND  And if things get better, then more power to him ENDEND  And I'll be the first to congratulate him ENDEND 

This may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper ENDEND  I am not well organized in that way ENDEND  And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system because I have bad filing, sorting and organizing habits ENDEND  And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff ENDEND  That seems trivial, but actually it ends up being a pretty big piece of business ENDEND 
I think what will happen with the President-elect is there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them ENDEND  Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States ENDEND  Everybody around the world is paying attention ENDEND  Markets move ENDEND  National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes ENDEND  And I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people ENDEND 
All right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions and then I get out of here ENDEND 
President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal that your Administration worked very hard to get ENDEND  What would be a concern if he alters part of it? And what would your advice be, considering that he said he’s open to advice?
And on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with massive destruction ENDEND  You spoke passionately a few years back about Benghazi and you warned against the killing of civilians there ENDEND  Many people criticized your Administration for the shortcoming of the Syria policy ENDEND  Are you willing to admit any fault under your watch? And how do you act with President-elect Trump says that he won't support the Syrian opposition? Thank you ENDEND 
 Iran is a good example of the gap I think between some of the rhetoric in this town  not unique to the President-elect  and the reality ENDEND  I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed ENDEND  And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that ENDEND  It was a serious debate ENDEND  I think people of goodwill were on both sides of the issue ENDEND  Ultimately, we were able to persuade members of Congress and the public  at least enough of them  to support it ENDEND 
At the time, the main argument against it was Iran wouldn’t abide by the deal, that they would cheat ENDEND  We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement ENDEND  That's not just my opinion, it's not just people in my Administration ENDEND  That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a government that vehemently opposed the deal ENDEND 
So my suspicion is, is that when the Presidentelect comes in, and he’s consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts ENDEND  Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain  particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon ENDEND 
And keep in mind this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P+, other countries, some of our closest allies ENDEND  And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do ENDEND 
So it becomes more difficult I think to undo something that’s working than undo something that isn’t working ENDEND  And when you’re not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal ENDEND  When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you’re more likely to look at the facts ENDEND 
That is going to be true in other circumstances ENDEND  For example, the Paris agreement ENDEND  There’s been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement ENDEND  Now, you’ve got  countries that have signed up to this thing ENDEND  And the good news is that what we’ve been able to show over the last five, six, eight years is that it’s possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well ENDEND 
It’s not just a bunch of rules that we’ve set up ENDEND  You’ve got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs ENDEND  You’ve got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set ENDEND  Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it’s good for the environment ENDEND 
You’ve got states like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any federal regulations that have been put forward ENDEND  In fact,  percent of the country already lives under  in states that are actively pursuing what’s embodied in the Paris agreement and the Clean Power Plan rule ENDEND  And even states like Texas that politically tend to oppose me  you’ve seen huge increases in wind power and solar power ENDEND  And you’ve got some of the country’s biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it’s good for their bottom line ENDEND 
So what we’ve been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works ENDEND  And it’s made our economy more efficient, it’s helped the bottom line of folks, and it’s cleaned up the environment ENDEND 
What the Paris agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let’s work together so you guys do the same thing ENDEND 
And the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn’t going to come from us  because we only have  million people ENDEND  It’s going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people ENDEND  And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off ENDEND 
And so, again, do I think that the new Administration will make some changes? Absolutely ENDEND  But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across Administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they’re doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us ENDEND 
Last question ENDEND  Justin Sink ENDEND 
Question: Sir, on Syria ENDEND 
 I’m sorry, I’m sorry ENDEND  Okay, you’re right ENDEND  You are right about that ENDEND 
With respect to Syria  in Benghazi, we had an international mandate ENDEND  We had a United Nations  Security resolution ENDEND  We had a broadbased coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly ENDEND  It’s no secret  you know this region well  that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction ENDEND 
And so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately ENDEND  We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge ENDEND  John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there ENDEND  But if what you’re asking is do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different ENDEND  We don’t have that option easily available to us ENDEND 
And so we’re going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can on the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and ceasefires that at least alleviate the suffering that’s on the ground ENDEND 
I recognize that that has not worked ENDEND  And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end ENDEND  But I think it’s not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now have substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our numberone national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa  that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya ENDEND 
And obviously there are some who question the steps we took in Libya ENDEND  I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there and now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place ENDEND 
I’ve given you  last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg ENDEND 
I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump Administration ENDEND  One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the federal government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program ENDEND  I’m wondering if there’s anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump Administration, considering his stance on immigration ENDEND 
And the second is, the Administration and you have long maintained that the legal constraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as CommanderinChief ENDEND  Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump Administration, is this now the time to sort of test that theory by moving the detainees and see where the chips will lie?
 Those are both excellent questions ENDEND  On the deferred action program that we have known as DACA that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefitting from these provisions, I will urge the Presidentelect and the incoming Administration to think long and hard before they are endangering that status of what for all practical purposes are American kids ENDEND 
These are kids who were brought here by their parents ENDEND  They did nothing wrong ENDEND  They've gone to school ENDEND  They have pledged allegiance to the flag ENDEND  Some of them have joined the military ENDEND  They've enrolled in school ENDEND  By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character ENDEND  And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again ENDEND  And that's something that I will encourage the Presidentelect to look at ENDEND 
With respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us ENDEND  What is also true is we have greatly reduced the population ENDEND  You now have significantly less than a hundred people there ENDEND  There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next two months ENDEND 
There is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States ENDEND  But because of the nature of the evidence, in some cases, that evidence being compromised, it’s very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court ENDEND  And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us ENDEND  My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by United States   jurisdiction ENDEND  We’d do it a lot cheaper and just as safely ENDEND 
Congress disagrees with me, and I gather that the Presidentelect does, as well ENDEND  We will continue to explore options for doing that ENDEND  But keep in mind that it’s not just a matter of what I’m willing to do ENDEND  One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws, and you got to pay attention to them ENDEND  And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms ENDEND  And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President ENDEND 
I am very proud of the fact that we will  knock on wood  leave this Administration without significant scandal ENDEND  We've made mistakes, there have been screwups, but I will put the ethics of this Administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms, and keeping trust with the American people  I will put this Administration against any Administration in history ENDEND 
And the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers ENDEND  And we had a strong White House Counsel’s Office ENDEND  We had a strong Ethics Office ENDEND  We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things ENDEND  It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it’s supposed to  because we got  million people working in the federal government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could ENDEND  And that takes a lot of work ENDEND 
And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously, as well ENDEND  Again, you wouldn’t know this if you were listening to some news outlets, or some members of oversight committees in Congress ENDEND  But if you actually look at the facts, it works ENDEND 
And this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the federal government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing ENDEND  You look at VA ENDEND  People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix ENDEND  It was scandalous what happened ENDEND  What people don’t remember is, is that we’ve brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren’t getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half ENDEND  Just made the agency work better  not work perfect, but work better ENDEND 
And one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good ENDEND  Perfect is unattainable ENDEND  Better is possible ENDEND 
And so we will try to share the lessons that we’ve learned over these last eight years with the incoming President ENDEND  And my hope is he makes things better ENDEND  And if he does, we’ll all benefit from it ENDEND 
All right? Thank you, everybody ENDEND  You guys, some of you who are traveling, you’ll get a chance to ask more questions ENDEND  All right?
Thank you ENDEND 

Well, I just had the opportunity to have an excellent conversation with Presidentelect Trump ENDEND  It was wideranging ENDEND  We talked about some of the organizational issues in setting up the White House ENDEND  We talked about foreign policy ENDEND  We talked about domestic policy ENDEND  And as I said last night, my numberone priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our Presidentelect is successful ENDEND 
And I have been very encouraged by the, I think, interest in President  Presidentelect Trump's wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces ENDEND  And I believe that it is important for all of us, regardless of party and regardless of political preferences, to now come together, work together, to deal with the many challenges that we face ENDEND 
And in the meantime, Michelle has had a chance to greet the incoming First Lady ENDEND  And we had an excellent conversation with her as well, and we want to make sure that they feel welcome as they prepare to make this transition ENDEND 



Good afternoon, everybody ENDEND 
Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people, regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the sun would come up in the morning ENDEND 
And that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true ENDEND  The sun is up ENDEND  And I know everybody had a long night ENDEND  I did as well ENDEND  I had a chance to talk to Presidentelect Trump last night about : in the morning, I think it was, to congratulate him on winning the election ENDEND  And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our presidencies ENDEND 
Now, it is no secret that the presidentelect and I have some pretty significant differences ENDEND  But remember, eight years ago President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences ENDEND  But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running ENDEND 
And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the presidency and the vice presidency is bigger than any of us ENDEND  So I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set eight years ago, and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the Presidentelect  because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country ENDEND  The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy ENDEND  And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world ENDEND 
I also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton and I just had a chance to hear her remarks ENDEND  I could not be prouder of her ENDEND  She has lived an extraordinary life of public service ENDEND  She was a great First Lady ENDEND  She was an outstanding senator for the state of New York ENDEND  And she could not have been a better secretary of state ENDEND 
I'm proud of her ENDEND  A lot of Americans look up to her ENDEND  Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics ENDEND  And I'm absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world ENDEND 
Now, everybody is sad when their side loses an election, but the day after we have to remember that we're actually all on one team ENDEND  This is an "intramural scrimmage ENDEND " We're not Democrats first ENDEND  We're not Republicans first ENDEND  We are Americans first ENDEND  We're patriots first ENDEND 
We all what  want what's best for this country ENDEND  That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night ENDEND  That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly ENDEND  And I was heartened by that ENDEND  That's what the country needs  a sense of unity, a sense of inclusion, a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law, and a respect for each other ENDEND  I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition ENDEND  And I certainly hope that's how his presidency has a chance to begin ENDEND 
I also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done, day in, day out, often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of  a lot of attention  work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make government run better, and make it more responsive, and make it more efficient, and make it more servicefriendly so that it's actually helping more people ENDEND  That remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed eight years ago ENDEND 
So win or lose in this election, that was always our mission ENDEND  That was our mission from day one ENDEND  And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done; and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools, doctors in E ENDEND R ENDEND  clinic, small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well, all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every state, the work of perfecting this union ENDEND 
So this was a long and hard fought campaign ENDEND  A lot of our fellow Americans are exalted today; a lot of Americans are less so, but that's the nature of campaigns ENDEND  That's the nature of democracy ENDEND  It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy and it's not always inspiring ENDEND 
But to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged ENDEND  Don't get cynical ENDEND  Don't ever think you can't make a difference ENDEND  As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it ENDEND  Sometimes you lose an argument; sometimes you lose an election ENDEND 
You know, the path that this country has taken has never been a straight line ENDEND  We zig and zag and sometimes, you know, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back, and that's okay ENDEND  I've lost elections before ENDEND  Joe hasn't, but, you know  So I've been  I've been sort of sharing 
Vice President Biden: I remember you beat me badly ENDEND 
 That's the way politics works sometimes ENDEND  We  We try really hard to persuade people that we're right and then people vote ENDEND  And then if we lose, we learn from our mistakes ENDEND  We do some reflection ENDEND  We lick our wounds ENDEND  We brush ourselves off ENDEND  We get back in the arena ENDEND  We go at it ENDEND  We try even harder the next time ENDEND 
The point, though, is is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy ENDEND  That's how this country has moved forward for  years ENDEND  It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world ENDEND  That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens ENDEND  It's how we have come this far ENDEND 
And that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on, as Americans, will go on ENDEND  And I'm looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that ENDEND 
I've said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner ENDEND  You take the baton ENDEND  You run your best race ENDEND  And hopefully by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress ENDEND  And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed because ultimately we're all on the same team ENDEND 
All right? Thank you very much, everybody ENDEND 

Zvia, Yoni, Chemi and generations of the Peres family; President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; members of the Israeli government and the Knesset; heads of state and the government and guests from around the world, including President Abbas, whose presence here is a gesture and a reminder of the unfinished business of peace; to the people of Israel: I could not be more honored to be in Jerusalem to say farewell to my friend Shimon Peres, who showed us that justice and hope are at the heart of the Zionist idea ENDEND 
A free life, in a homeland regained ENDEND  A secure life, in a nation that can defend itself, by itself ENDEND  A full life, in friendship with nations who can be counted on as allies, always ENDEND  A bountiful life, driven by simple pleasures of family and by big dreams ENDEND  This was Shimon Peres's life ENDEND  This is the State of Israel ENDEND  This is the story of the Jewish people over the last century, and it was made possible by a founding generation that counts Shimon as one of its own ENDEND 
Shimon once said, “The message of the Jewish people to mankind is that faith and moral vision can triumph over all adversity ENDEND ” For Shimon, that moral vision was rooted in an honest reckoning of the world as it is ENDEND  Born in the shtetl, he said he felt, “surrounded by a sea of thick and threatening forests ENDEND ” When his family got the chance to go to Palestine, his beloved grandfather’s parting words were simple: “Shimon, stay a Jew ENDEND ” Propelled with that faith, he found his home ENDEND  He found his purpose ENDEND  He found his life’s work ENDEND  But he was still a teenager when his grandfather was burned alive by the Nazis in the town where Shimon was born ENDEND  The synagogue in which he prayed became an inferno ENDEND  The railroad tracks that had carried him toward the Promised Land also delivered so many of his people to death camps ENDEND 
And so from an early age, Shimon bore witness to the cruelty that human beings could inflict on each other, the ways that one group of people could dehumanize another; the particular madness of antiSemitism, which has run like a stain through history ENDEND  That understanding of man’s everpresent sinfulness would steel him against hardship and make him vigilant against threats to Jewry around the world ENDEND 
But that understanding would never harden his heart ENDEND  It would never extinguish his faith ENDEND  Instead, it broadened his moral imagination, and gave him the capacity to see all people as deserving of dignity and respect ENDEND  It helped him see not just the world as it is, but the world as it should be ENDEND 
What Shimon did to shape the story of Israel is wellchronicled ENDEND  Starting on the kibbutz he founded with his love Sonya, he began the work of building a model community ENDEND  Ben Gurion called him to serve the Haganah at headquarters to make sure that the Jewish people had the armaments and the organization to secure their freedom ENDEND  After independence, surrounded by enemies who denied Israel’s existence and sought to drive it into the sea, the child who had wanted to be a “poet of stars” became a man who built Israel’s defense industry, who laid the foundation for the formidable armed forces that won Israel’s wars ENDEND  His skill secured Israel’s strategic position ENDEND  His boldness sent Israeli commandos to Entebbe, and rescued Jews from Ethiopia ENDEND  His statesmanship built an unbreakable bond with the United States of America and so many other countries ENDEND 
His contributions didn't end there ENDEND  Shimon also showed what people can do when they harness reason and science to a common cause ENDEND  He understood that a country without many natural resources could more than make up for it with the talents of its people ENDEND  He made hard choices to roll back inflation and climb up from a terrible economic crisis ENDEND  He championed the promise of science and technology to make the desert bloom, and turned this tiny country into a central hub of the digital age, making life better not just for people here, but for people around the world ENDEND 
Indeed, Shimon’s contribution to this nation is so fundamental, so pervasive, that perhaps sometimes they can be overlooked ENDEND  For a younger generation, Shimon was probably remembered more for a peace process that never reached its endpoint ENDEND  They would listen to critics on the left who might argue that Shimon did not fully acknowledge the failings of his nation, or perhaps more numerous critics on the right who argued that he refused to see the true wickedness of the world, and called him naïve ENDEND 
But whatever he shared with his family or his closest friends, to the world he brushed off the critics ENDEND  And I know from my conversations with him that his pursuit of peace was never naïve ENDEND  Every Yom HaShoah, he read the names of the family that he lost ENDEND  As a young man, he had fed his village by working in the fields during the day, but then defending it by carrying a rifle at night ENDEND  He understood, in this wartorn region, where too often Arab youth are taught to hate Israel from an early age  he understood just how hard peace would be ENDEND  I'm sure he was alternatively angry and bemused to hear the same critics, who called him hopelessly naïve, depend on the defense architecture that he himself had helped to build ENDEND 
I don’t believe he was naïve ENDEND  But he understood from hardearned experience that true security comes through making peace with your neighbors ENDEND  “We won them all,” he said of Israel’s wars ENDEND  “But we did not win the greatest victory that we aspired to: release from the need to win victories ENDEND ”
And just as he understood the practical necessity of peace, Shimon believed that Israel’s exceptionalism was rooted not only in fidelity to the Jewish people, but to the moral and ethical vision, the precepts of his Jewish faith ENDEND  “The Jewish people weren’t born to rule another people,” he would say ENDEND  “From the very first day we are against slaves and masters ENDEND ”
Out of the hardships of the diaspora, he found room in his heart for others who suffered ENDEND  He came to hate prejudice with the passion of one who knows how it feels to be its target ENDEND  Even in the face of terrorist attacks, even after repeated disappointments at the negotiation table, he insisted that as human beings, Palestinians must be seen as equal in dignity to Jews, and must therefore be equal in selfdetermination ENDEND  Because of his sense of justice, his analysis of Israel’s security, his understanding of Israel’s meaning, he believed that the Zionist idea would be best protected when Palestinians, too, had a state of their own ENDEND 
Of course, we gather here in the knowledge that Shimon never saw his dream of peace fulfilled ENDEND  The region is going through a chaotic time ENDEND  Threats are ever present ENDEND  And yet, he did not stop dreaming, and he did not stop working ENDEND  By the time that I came to work with Shimon, he was in the twilight of his years  although he might not admit it ENDEND  I would be the th United States   President since John F ENDEND  Kennedy to sit down with Shimon; the th to fall prey to his charms ENDEND 
I think of him sitting in the Oval Office, this final member of Israel’s founding generation, under the portrait of George Washington, telling me stories from the past, but more often talking with enthusiasm of the present  his most recent lecture, his next project, his plans for the future, the wonders of his grandchildren ENDEND 
In many ways, he reminded me of some other giants of the th century that I’ve had the honor to meet  men like Nelson Mandela; women like Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth  leaders who have seen so much, whose lives span such momentous epochs, that they find no need to posture or traffic in what’s popular in the moment; people who speak with depth and knowledge, not in sound bites ENDEND  They find no interest in polls or fads ENDEND 
And like these leaders, Shimon could be true to his convictions even if they cut against the grain of current opinion ENDEND  He knew, better than the cynic, that if you look out over the arc of history, human beings should be filled not with fear but with hope ENDEND  I'm sure that's why he was so excited about technology  because for him, it symbolized the march of human progress ENDEND  And it’s why he loved so much to talk about young people  because he saw young people unburdened by the prejudices of the past ENDEND  It’s why he believed in miracles  because in Israel, he saw a miracle come true ENDEND 
As Americans and Israelis, we often talk about the unbreakable bonds between our nations ENDEND  And, yes, these bonds encompass common interests  vital cooperation that makes both our nations more secure ENDEND  But today we are reminded that the bonds which matter most run deeper ENDEND  Anchored in a JudeoChristian tradition, we believe in the irreducible value of every human being ENDEND  Our nations were built on that idea ENDEND  They were built in large part by stubborn idealists and striving immigrants, including those who had fled war and fled oppression ENDEND  Both our nations have flaws that we have not always fixed, corners of our history which date back to our founding that we do not always squarely address ENDEND  But because our founders planted not just flags in the eternal soil, but also planted the seeds of democracy, we have the ability to always pursue a better world ENDEND  We have the capacity to do what is right ENDEND 
As an American, as a Christian, a person partly of African descent, born in Hawaii  a place that could not be further than where Shimon spent his youth  I took great pleasure in my friendship with this older, wiser man ENDEND  We shared a love of words and books and history ENDEND  And perhaps, like most politicians, we shared too great a joy in hearing ourselves talk ENDEND  But beyond that, I think our friendship was rooted in the fact that I could somehow see myself in his story, and maybe he could see himself in mine ENDEND  Because for all of our differences, both of us had lived such unlikely lives ENDEND  It was so surprising to see the two of us where we had started, talking together in the White House, meeting here in Israel ENDEND  And I think both of us understood that we were here only because in some way we reflected the magnificent story of our nations ENDEND 
Shimon’s story, the story of Israel, the experience of the Jewish people, I believe it is universal ENDEND  It’s the story of a people who, over so many centuries in the wilderness, never gave up on that basic human longing to return home ENDEND  It’s the story of a people who suffered the boot of oppression and the shutting of the gas chamber’s door, and yet never gave up on a belief in goodness ENDEND  And it’s the story of a man who was counted on, and then often counted out, again and again, and who never lost hope ENDEND 
Shimon Peres reminds us that the State of Israel, like the United States of America, was not built by cynics ENDEND  We exist because people before us refused to be constrained by the past or the difficulties of the present ENDEND  And Shimon Peres was never cynical ENDEND  It is that faith, that optimism, that belief  even when all the evidence is to the contrary  that tomorrow can be better, that makes us not just honor Shimon Peres, but love him ENDEND 
The last of the founding generation is now gone ENDEND  Shimon accomplished enough things in his life for a thousand men ENDEND  But he understood that it is better to live to the very end of his time on Earth with a longing not for the past but for the dreams that have not yet come true  an Israel that is secure in a just and lasting peace with its neighbors ENDEND  And so now this work is in the hand of Israel’s next generation, in the hands of Israel's next generation and its friends ENDEND 
Like Joshua, we feel the weight of responsibility that Shimon seemed to wear so lightly ENDEND  But we draw strength from his example and the fact that he believed in us  even when we doubted ourselves ENDEND 
Scripture tells us that before his death, Moses said:
I call upon heaven and earth to bear witness this day that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse; therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live ENDEND 
Uvacharta Bachayim ENDEND  Choose life ENDEND  For Shimon, let us choose life, as he always did ENDEND  Let us make his work our own ENDEND  May God bless his memory ENDEND  And may God bless this country, and this world, that he loved so dearly ENDEND 
Shimon: Todah Rabah Chaver Yakar ENDEND 
 "Thank you very much, dear friend"

James Baldwin once wrote, For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard ENDEND ” For while the tale of how we suffer, and how we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard ENDEND 
Today, as so many generations have before, we gather on our National Mall to tell an essential part of our American story  one that has at times been overlooked  we come not just for today, but for all time ENDEND 
President and Mrs ENDEND  Bush; President Clinton; Vice President and Dr ENDEND  Biden; Chief Justice Roberts; Secretary Skorton; Reverend Butts; distinguished guests: Thank you ENDEND  Thank you for your leadership in making sure this tale is told ENDEND  We’re here in part because of you and because of all those Americans  the Civil War vets, the Civil Rights foot soldiers, the champions of this effort on Capitol Hill  who, for more than a century, kept the dream of this museum alive ENDEND 
That includes our leaders in Congress  Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi ENDEND  It includes one of my heroes, John Lewis, who, as he has so often, took the torch from those who came before him and brought us past the finish line ENDEND  It includes the philanthropists and benefactors and advisory members who have so generously given not only their money but their time ENDEND  It includes the Americans who offered up all the family keepsakes tucked away in Grandma’s attic ENDEND  And of course, it includes a man without whose vision and passion and persistence we would not be here today  Mr. Lonnie Bunch ENDEND 
What we can see of this building  the towering glass, the artistry of the metalwork  is surely a sight to behold ENDEND  But beyond the majesty of the building, what makes this occasion so special is the larger story it contains ENDEND  Below us, this building reaches down  feet, its roots spreading far wider and deeper than any tree on this Mall ENDEND  And on its lowest level, after you walk past remnants of a slave ship, after you reflect on the immortal declaration that “all men are created equal,” you can see a block of stone ENDEND  On top of this stone sits a historical marker, weathered by the ages ENDEND  That marker reads: “General Andrew Jackson and Henry Clay spoke from this slave block…during the year  ENDEND ”
I want you to think about this ENDEND  Consider what this artifact tells us about history, about how it’s told, and about what can be cast aside ENDEND  On a stone where day after day, for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle; on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet  for a long time, the only thing we considered important, the singular thing we once chose to commemorate as “history” with a plaque were the unmemorable speeches of two powerful men ENDEND 
And that block I think explains why this museum is so necessary ENDEND  Because that same object, reframed, put in context, tells us so much more ENDEND  As Americans, we rightfully passed on the tales of the giants who built this country; who led armies into battle and waged seminal debates in the halls of Congress and the corridors of power ENDEND  But too often, we ignored or forgot the stories of millions upon millions of others, who built this nation just as surely, whose humble eloquence, whose calloused hands, whose steady drive helped to create cities, erect industries, build the arsenals of democracy ENDEND 
And so this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are ENDEND  It helps us better understand the lives, yes, of the President, but also the slave; the industrialist, but also the porter; the keeper of the status quo, but also of the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo; the teacher or the cook, alongside the statesman ENDEND  And by knowing this other story, we better understand ourselves and each other ENDEND  It binds us together ENDEND  It reaffirms that all of us are America  that AfricanAmerican history is not somehow separate from our larger American story, it's not the underside of the American story, it is central to the American story ENDEND  That our glory derives not just from our most obvious triumphs, but how we’ve wrested triumph from tragedy, and how we've been able to remake ourselves, again and again and again, in accordance with our highest ideals ENDEND 
I, too, am America ENDEND 
The great historian John Hope Franklin, who helped to get this museum started, once said, “Good history is a good foundation for a better present and future ENDEND ” He understood the best history doesn’t just sit behind a glass case; it helps us to understand what’s outside the case ENDEND  The best history helps us recognize the mistakes that we’ve made and the dark corners of the human spirit that we need to guard against ENDEND  And, yes, a cleareyed view of history can make us uncomfortable, and shake us out of familiar narratives ENDEND  But it is precisely because of that discomfort that we learn and grow and harness our collective power to make this nation more perfect ENDEND 
That’s the American story that this museum tells  one of suffering and delight; one of fear but also of hope; of wandering in the wilderness and then seeing out on the horizon a glimmer of the Promised Land ENDEND 
It is in this embrace of truth, as best as we can know it, in the celebration of the entire American experience, where real patriotism lies ENDEND  As President Bush just said, a great nation doesn’t shy from the truth ENDEND  It strengthens us ENDEND  It emboldens us ENDEND  It should fortify us ENDEND  It is an act of patriotism to understand where we've been ENDEND  And this museum tells the story of so many patriots ENDEND 
Yes, African Americans have felt the cold weight of shackles and the stinging lash of the field whip ENDEND  But we’ve also dared to run north, and sing songs from Harriet Tubman’s hymnal ENDEND  We’ve buttoned up our Union Blues to join the fight for our freedom ENDEND  We’ve railed against injustice for decade upon decade  a lifetime of struggle, and progress, and enlightenment that we see etched in Frederick Douglass’s mighty, leonine gaze ENDEND 
Yes, this museum tells a story of people who felt the indignity, the small and large humiliations of a “whites only” sign, or wept at the side of Emmett Till’s coffin, or fell to their knees on shards of stained glass outside a church where four little girls died ENDEND  But it also tells the story of the black youth and white youth sitting alongside each other, straightbacked, so full of dignity on those lunch counter stools; the story of a sixyearold Ruby Bridges, pigtails, freshpressed dress, walking that gauntlet to get to school; Tuskegee airmen soaring the skies not just to beat a dictator, but to reaffirm the promise of our democracy  but remind us that all of us are created equal ENDEND 
This is the place to understand how protest and love of country don’t merely coexist but inform each other; how men can proudly win the gold for their country but still insist on raising a blackgloved fist; how we can wear “I Can’t Breathe” Tshirt and still grieve for fallen police officers ENDEND  Here’s the America where the razorsharp uniform of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff belongs alongside the cape of the Godfather of Soul ENDEND  We have shown the world that we can float like butterflies and sting like bees; that we can rocket into space like Mae Jemison, steal home like Jackie, rock like Jimi, stir the pot like Richard Pryor; or we can be sick and tired of being sick and tired, like Fannie Lou Hamer, and still Rock Steady like Aretha Franklin ENDEND 
We are large, Walt Whitman told us, containing multitudes ENDEND  We are large, containing multitudes ENDEND  Full of contradictions ENDEND  That's America ENDEND  That's what makes us grow ENDEND  That's what makes us extraordinary ENDEND  And as is true for America, so is true for African American experience ENDEND  We're not a burden on America, or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America ENDEND  We're America ENDEND 
And that's what this museum explains  the fact that our stories have shaped every corner of our culture ENDEND  The struggles for freedom that took place made our Constitution a real and living document, tested and shaped and deepened and made more profound its meaning for all people ENDEND  The story told here doesn’t just belong to black Americans; it belongs to all Americans  for the AfricanAmerican experience has been shaped just as much by Europeans and Asians and Native Americans and Latinos ENDEND  We have informed each other ENDEND  We are polyglot, a stew ENDEND 
Scripture promised that if we lift up the oppressed, then our light will rise in the darkness, and our night will become like the noonday ENDEND  And the story contained in this museum makes those words prophecy ENDEND  And that’s what this day is about ENDEND  That’s what this museum is about ENDEND  I, too, am America ENDEND  It is a glorious story, the one that's told here ENDEND  It is complicated and it is messy and it is full of contradictions, as all great stories are, as Shakespeare is, as Scripture is ENDEND  And it’s a story that perhaps needs to be told now more than ever ENDEND 
A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city or every rural hamlet ENDEND  It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind ENDEND  It won't wipe away every instance of discrimination in a job interview or a sentencing hearing or folks trying to rent an apartment ENDEND  Those things are up to us, the decisions and choices we make ENDEND  It requires speaking out, and organizing, and voting, until our values are fully reflected in our laws and our policies and our communities ENDEND 
But what this museum does show us is that in even the face of oppression, even in the face of unimaginable difficulty, America has moved forward ENDEND  And so this museum provides context for the debates of our times ENDEND  It illuminates them and gives us some sense of how they evolved, and perhaps keeps them in proportion ENDEND  Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Tulsa and Charlotte ENDEND  But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past but, within the white communities across this nation we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand, and are trying to do the right thing ENDEND 
It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history, it's just a blink in the eye of history ENDEND  It was just yesterday ENDEND  And so we should not be surprised that not all the healing is done ENDEND  We shouldn’t despair that it’s not all solved ENDEND  And knowing the larger story should instead remind us of just how remarkable the changes that have taken place truly are  just in my lifetime  and thereby inspire us to further progress ENDEND 
And so hopefully this museum can help us talk to each other ENDEND  And more importantly, listen to each other ENDEND  And most importantly, see each other ENDEND  Black and white and Latino and Native American and Asian American  see how our stories are bound together ENDEND  And bound together with women in America, and workers in America, and entrepreneurs in America, and LGBT Americans ENDEND  And for young people who didn’t live through the struggles represented here, I hope you draw strength from the changes that have taken place ENDEND  Come here and see the power of your own agency ENDEND  See how young John Lewis was ENDEND  These were children who transformed a nation in a blink of an eye ENDEND  Young people, come here and see your ability to make your mark ENDEND 
The very fact of this day does not prove that America is perfect, but it does validate the ideas of our founding, that this country born of change, this country born of revolution, this country of we, the people, this country can get better ENDEND 
And that’s why we celebrate, mindful that our work is not yet done; mindful that we are but on a waystation on this common journey towards freedom ENDEND  And how glorious it is that we enshrine it here, on some of our nation’s most hallowed ground  the same place where lives were once traded but also where hundreds of thousands of Americans, of all colors and creeds, once marched ENDEND  How joyful it is that this story take its rightful place  alongside Jefferson who declared our independence, and Washington who made it real, and alongside Lincoln who saved our union, and the GIs who defended it; alongside a new monument to a King, gazing outward, summoning us toward that mountaintop ENDEND  How righteous it is that with tell this story here ENDEND 
For almost eight years, I have been blessed with the extraordinary honor of serving you in this office ENDEND  Time and again, I’ve flown low over this mall on Marine One, often with Michelle and our daughters ENDEND  And President Clinton, President Bush, they’ll tell you it is incredible sight ENDEND  We pass right across the Washington Monument  it feels like you can reach out and touch it ENDEND  And at night, if you turn the other way, you don't just see the Lincoln Memorial, Old Abe is lit up and you can see him, his spirit glowing from that building ENDEND  And we don’t have many trips left ENDEND  But over the years, I’ve always been comforted as I’ve watched this museum rise from this earth into this remarkable tribute ENDEND  Because I know that years from now, like all of you, Michelle and I will be able to come here to this museum, and not just bring our kids but hopefully our grandkids ENDEND  I imagine holding a little hand of somebody and tell them the stories that are enshrined here ENDEND 
And in the years that follow, they’ll be able to do the same ENDEND  And then we’ll go to the Lincoln Memorial and we'll take in the view atop the Washington Monument ENDEND  And together, we’ll learn about ourselves, as Americans  our sufferings, our delights, and our triumphs ENDEND  And we’ll walk away better for it, better because the better grasp of history ENDEND  We'll walk away that much more in love with this country, the only place on Earth where this story could have unfolded ENDEND 
It is a monument, no less than the others on this Mall, to the deep and abiding love for this country, and the ideals upon which it is founded ENDEND  For we, too, are America ENDEND 
So enough talk ENDEND  President Bush is timing me ENDEND  He had the overunder at  ENDEND  Let us now open this museum to the world ENDEND  Today, we have with us a family that reflects the arc of our progress: the Bonner family  four generations in all, starting with gorgeous sevenyearold Christine and going up to gorgeous yearold Ruth ENDEND 
Now, Ruth’s father, Elijah Odom, was born into servitude in Mississippi ENDEND  He was born a slave ENDEND  As a young boy, he ran, though, to his freedom ENDEND  He lived through Reconstruction and he lived through Jim Crow ENDEND  But he went on to farm, and graduate from medical school, and gave life to the beautiful family that we see today  with a spirit reflected in beautiful Christine, free and equal in the laws of her country and in the eyes of God ENDEND 
So in a brief moment, their family will join us in ringing a bell from the First Baptist Church in Virginia  one of the oldest black churches in America, founded under a grove of trees in  ENDEND  And the sound of this bell will be echoed by others in houses of worship and town squares all across this country  an echo of the ringing bells that signaled Emancipation more than a century and a half ago; the sound, and the anthem, of American freedom ENDEND 
God bless you all ENDEND  God bless the United States of America ENDEND 


From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth ENDEND  We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy ENDEND  We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest warm, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly ENDEND  Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence ENDEND  And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change ENDEND 
This is important work ENDEND  It has made a real difference in the lives of our people ENDEND  And it could not have happened had we not worked together ENDEND  And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order ENDEND 
We see it in the headlines every day ENDEND  Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict ENDEND  Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities ENDEND  Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down ENDEND  We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information ENDEND  Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims ENDEND  Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law ENDEND 
This is the paradox that defines our world today ENDEND  A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife ENDEND  Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface ENDEND 
And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice ENDEND  We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration ENDEND  Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along ageold lines of nation and tribe and race and religion ENDEND 
I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not backward ENDEND  I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century ENDEND  I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts  facts that all too often, we forget in the immediacy of current events ENDEND 
Here’s the most important fact: The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children ENDEND  Over the last  years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly  percent of humanity to under  percent ENDEND  That's unprecedented ENDEND  And it's not an abstraction ENDEND  It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth ENDEND 
Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries ENDEND  The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single handheld device ENDEND  In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry ENDEND  And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history ENDEND 
Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders ENDEND  Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last  years ENDEND 
In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach ENDEND  An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power ENDEND  Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth ENDEND 
I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest complacency ENDEND  Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress ENDEND 
In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction ENDEND  As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions illequipped, underfunded, underresourced, in order to handle transnational challenges ENDEND 
And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism  sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right  which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination ENDEND 
We cannot dismiss these visions ENDEND  They are powerful ENDEND  They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens ENDEND  I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity ENDEND  Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications  together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain  makes it selfdefeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress ENDEND  Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself ENDEND 
So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration ENDEND  Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions  economic, political, and cultural  that are caused by integration are squarely addressed ENDEND  This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together ENDEND 
It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top ENDEND  While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage ENDEND  In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared ENDEND  Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers ENDEND 
In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment ENDEND  Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with exportdriven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade ENDEND  And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable  nearly  trillion dollars stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight ENDEND 
A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other  percent will never be stable ENDEND  I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others ENDEND  Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine people’s faith in the system ENDEND 
So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box ENDEND  Nor can we look to failed models of the past ENDEND  If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation  these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict ENDEND  And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end ENDEND 
But I do believe there’s another path  one that fuels growth and innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success ENDEND  It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is broadly based ENDEND  And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage ENDEND  It means investing in our people  their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business ENDEND  It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks  to look for a new job, or start a new venture ENDEND 
These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States, and with clear results ENDEND  American businesses have created now  million new jobs ENDEND  After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than  percent of income growth ENDEND  But today, that's down to about half ENDEND  Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly  years ENDEND  And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress will continue ENDEND 
So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism  not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it ENDEND  That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation  because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within ENDEND  That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe ENDEND  That’s why we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we've done with the TransPacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared ENDEND 
And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe ENDEND  This is difficult politically ENDEND  It's difficult to spend on foreign assistance ENDEND  But I do not believe this is charity ENDEND  For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods ENDEND  It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do ENDEND 
And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change ENDEND  If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair ENDEND  The Paris Agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition ENDEND  And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force, and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy ENDEND 
So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be the beginning ENDEND  We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries ENDEND  And only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair ENDEND 
So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable ENDEND  And in the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people ENDEND 
I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance ENDEND  I do not think that America can  or should  impose our system of government on other countries ENDEND  But there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now ENDEND  And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest ENDEND  I believe in a liberal political order  an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law ENDEND 
I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies ENDEND  And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave ENDEND  It turns out building accountable institutions is hard work  the work of generations ENDEND  The gains are often fragile ENDEND  Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back ENDEND  In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zerosum game ENDEND  And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman, a topdown model, rather than strong, democratic institutions ENDEND 
But I believe this thinking is wrong ENDEND  I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path ENDEND  I believe that in the st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up  because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs to check the abuses of power ENDEND  Without this evolution, ultimately expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set in ENDEND  And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths  permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war ENDEND 
Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story ENDEND  Our nation began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few ENDEND  But because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest, and ultimately, those ideals won out  opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States ENDEND 
So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America ENDEND  Look at the transformation that's taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia, Botswana ENDEND  The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake ENDEND 
In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not ENDEND  After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad ENDEND  They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse ENDEND  They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own ENDEND 
So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side ENDEND  That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws ENDEND  It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens  not less ENDEND 
Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote ENDEND  In Europe, a wellintentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics ENDEND  Too often, in capitals, decisionmakers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down ENDEND  And so these are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at home ENDEND 
Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply held beliefs of its people ENDEND  So I recognize a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea  the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain Godgiven rights ENDEND  But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives ENDEND  I believe that spirit is universal ENDEND  And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity, and the opportunity to control their own lives ENDEND 
This leads me to the third thing we need to do: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity ENDEND  Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings ENDEND 
It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities ENDEND  We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves ENDEND  We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad ENDEND  In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force ENDEND  Asian powers debate competing claims of history ENDEND  And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries ENDEND 
Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions  from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood ENDEND  But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group ENDEND  If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray ENDEND  The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking ENDEND 
We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East ENDEND  There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated ENDEND  These forces built up for years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL ENDEND 
The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and bloodletting, and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed ENDEND  And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long ENDEND  But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy ENDEND 
And there is a military component to that ENDEND  It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life ENDEND  But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect ENDEND 
Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder ENDEND  Because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer  most of all in that region  but extremism will continue to be exported overseas ENDEND  And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies ENDEND 
And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us ENDEND  Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance ENDEND  Surely, we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation ENDEND  Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities  whether it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or a racial minority right here in the United States ENDEND  And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land ENDEND  We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others ENDEND 
And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations ENDEND 
As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar ENDEND  The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth ENDEND  I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington  and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well ENDEND  But I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow selfinterest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last  years  and I’ve acknowledged some  we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals ENDEND  And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good ENDEND 
We have secured allies ENDEND  We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable ENDEND  We supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions ENDEND  We’ve bound our power to international laws and institutions ENDEND  When we've made mistakes, we've tried to acknowledge them ENDEND  We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders ENDEND 
I'm proud of that ENDEND  But I also know that we can't do this alone ENDEND  And I believe that if we're to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity ENDEND  We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them ENDEND 
When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that enhances global security and enhances Iran's ability to work with other nations ENDEND  On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us ENDEND  And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences ENDEND  And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test them again ENDEND 
We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders  mosquitoes don't respect walls  unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola  by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure ENDEND 
We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper ENDEND  Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children  including our girls  the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world ENDEND  But we have to put our money where our mouths are ENDEND 
And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding  to replace the ravages of war with cooperation  if powerful nations like my own accept constraints ENDEND  Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions ENDEND  But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action  not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term  enhances our security ENDEND  And I think that's not just true for us ENDEND 
If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure ENDEND  In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs ENDEND 
We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong ENDEND  And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments ENDEND  Consider what we’ve accomplished here over the past few years ENDEND 
Together, we mobilized some , additional troops for United Nations  peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies ENDEND  Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe ENDEND  And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home ENDEND 
We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering ENDEND  I'll be discussing that more this afternoon ENDEND  But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard ENDEND  Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves ENDEND  We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us ENDEND  And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees ENDEND 
There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing ENDEND  But many nations  particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography  that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home ENDEND 
Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I've talked about here today ENDEND  There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt ENDEND  Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power ENDEND  Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around ENDEND  Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together ENDEND 
Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering ENDEND  Perhaps that's our fate ENDEND  We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war ENDEND  But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again ENDEND  Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best ENDEND  For we have shown that we can choose a better history ENDEND 
Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr ENDEND  wrote that, Human progress never rolls  on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God ENDEND ” And during the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations ENDEND  And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth ENDEND  But it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places  an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world ENDEND 
I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola ENDEND  I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar ENDEND  I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL ENDEND  I draw strength from the young Americans  entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens  who are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be ENDEND 
My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world  just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore ENDEND  And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up ENDEND  They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness ENDEND 
And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn't weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America  it strengthens it ENDEND  My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag ENDEND  But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons ENDEND 
This is what I believe: that all of us can be coworkers with God ENDEND  And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth ENDEND 
Thank you very much ENDEND 

Good morning, everybody ENDEND  I want to say a few words about the explosions that occurred here in New York City and New Jersey and the other devices that have been found in New Jersey ENDEND  I’ve been monitoring the situation closely and receiving frequent updates from my team ENDEND  And I’ve just been briefed again by FBI Director Comey ENDEND  In addition, I've had a chance to speak with Governors Cuomo and Christie, as well as Mayor de Blasio ENDEND 
We’ve seen what was apparently a pipe bomb go off in New Jersey, in Seaside Park, where it could have seriously injured our United States   Marines and spectators who were there for a race ENDEND  The bombing in the Chelsea neighborhood, here in New York, injured more than two dozen people ENDEND  We are extremely fortunate and grateful that nobody was killed ENDEND  And our prayers go out to all those who have been injured ENDEND  We want to wish them a speedy recovery ENDEND 
I especially want to commend all the outstanding police and first responders in both New York City and New Jersey for their extraordinary professionalism and their quick response, which surely prevented even more people from being hurt, and ensured that people got assistance quickly ENDEND 
The investigation is moving rapidly, and as is my practice, I’m going to leave it to the FBI and law enforcement to provide details ENDEND  I think everybody is aware at this point that there is a person of interest who is the focus of the investigation ENDEND  And the FBI can give you further details in terms of how that is proceeding ENDEND 
I told Governors Cuomo and Christie and Mayor de Blasio that they and their teams will continue to have all federal support as they move ahead with their investigations, and tracking down every lead, and working to keep the people of this city and of this region safe ENDEND  Law enforcement is asking for the help of the community ENDEND  And so to everybody in this region, I want to repeat what we've said before: If you see something suspicious, then you need to say something  contact local law enforcement ENDEND 
In the meantime, I would ask that the press try to refrain from getting out ahead of the investigation ENDEND  I am extraordinarily happy with the cooperation that's been taking place between the FBI and state and local law enforcement officials ENDEND  They are moving smartly on this investigation ENDEND  It does not help if false reports or incomplete information is out there ENDEND  So try to, as much as possible, stick to what our investigators say, because they actually know what they're talking about ENDEND 
Meanwhile, I know that the United Nations meetings here every year already create an additional workload for New York ENDEND  But given the United Nations  meetings, we also have a particularly high level of federal resources here to help as needed ENDEND  We’re going to make sure that everybody is working together seamlessly, as one team, to get to the bottom of what happened, to find those responsible, and to make sure that justice is done ENDEND 
Meanwhile, while all this is going on in New York and New Jersey, we’re also focused on the stabbing attack at the shopping mall in Minnesota ENDEND  At this point, we see no connection between that incident and what happened here in New York and New Jersey ENDEND  Our attention there is on the people who were injured ENDEND  And again, we are very grateful that no one lost their life ENDEND  Thanks to the quick action of a brave offduty police officer, the suspect was killed and we avoided more people being hurt ENDEND 
I had a chance also to speak with Governor Dayton this morning ENDEND  I assured him that we will provide all the assistance that he needs in the investigation ENDEND  The FBI is investigating the Minnesota incident as a potential act of terrorism ENDEND  We will direct the full resources of the federal government to make sure that the investigation goes forward aggressively ENDEND 
And finally, I want to take this opportunity to reassure the people in this city, in this region, and Americans across our country that our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals at every level  federal, state and local  are working together, around the clock, to prevent attacks and to keep us safe ENDEND  They are the best of the best ENDEND  Over the years, they have thwarted many plots and saved many lives ENDEND  And we are incredibly grateful for their service, today and every single day ENDEND 
We will continue to lead the global coalition in the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks ENDEND  We are going to continue to go after them ENDEND  We're going to take out their leaders ENDEND  We're going to take out their infrastructure ENDEND  They are continuing to lose ground in Iraq and in Syria ENDEND  And later today, I’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to discuss the need to sustain that momentum ENDEND  As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is ENDEND  And it helps to undermine their ideology, which over time will make it harder for them to recruit and inspire people to violence ENDEND  And we're going to continue to enlist tech companies and community and religious leaders to push back against online extremist content and all messages of hate ENDEND 
At moments like this, I think it’s important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do ENDEND  They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live, to undermine our values ENDEND  And so, even as we have to be vigilant and aggressive, both in preventing senseless acts of violence but also making sure that we find those who carry out such acts and bring them to justice, we all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don’t succumb to that fear ENDEND  And there’s no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey ENDEND 
When I was speaking to Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie and Mayor De Blasio, one point that they all made is, folks around here, they don’t get scared ENDEND  They’re tough, they’re resilient, they go about their business every single day ENDEND  And that kind of toughness and resoluteness, and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life, that’s the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American ENDEND  And that’s the kind of strength that is going to be absolutely critical not just in the days to come but in the years to come ENDEND 
By showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not, and never will, give in to fear, that’s going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry our terrorist acts against us ENDEND 
Thank you very much, everybody ENDEND  And as I said, you will be receiving, I’m sure, ongoing briefings from both the FBI and local law enforcement in terms of the details of the investigation ENDEND 


Good morning ENDEND  Scripture tells us, “Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart ENDEND ”
Secretary Carter, Chairman Dunford, outstanding members of our Armed Forces, and most of all, survivors of that September day and the families of those we lost  it is a great honor, once again, to be with you on this day, a day that I know is still difficult, but which reveals the love and faithfulness in your hearts and in the heart of our nation ENDEND 
We remember, and we will never forget, the nearly , beautiful lives taken from us so cruelly  including  men, women and children here, the youngest just three years old ENDEND  We honor the courage of those who put themselves in harm’s way to save people they never knew ENDEND  We come together in prayer and in gratitude for the strength that has fortified us across these  years ENDEND  And we renew the love and the faith that binds us together as one American family ENDEND 
Fifteen years may seem like a long time, but for the families who lost a piece of their heart that day, I imagine it can seem like just yesterday ENDEND  Perhaps it’s the memory of a last kiss given to a spouse, or the last goodbye to a mother or father, a sister or a brother ENDEND  We wonder how their lives might have unfolded, how their dreams might have taken shape ENDEND  And I am mindful that no words we offer, or deeds we do, can ever truly erase the pain of their absence ENDEND 
And yet, you  the survivors and families of   your “steadfast love and faithfulness” has been an inspiration to me and to our entire country ENDEND  Even as you’ve mourned, you’ve summoned the strength to carry on ENDEND  In the names of those you’ve lost, you’ve started scholarships and volunteered in your communities, and done your best to be a good neighbor and a good friend and a good citizen ENDEND  And in your grief and grace, you have reminded us that, together, there’s nothing we Americans cannot overcome ENDEND 
The question before us, as always, is: How do we preserve the legacy of those we lost? How do we live up to their example? And how do we keep their spirit alive in our own hearts?
Well, we have seen the answer in a generation of Americans  our men and women in uniform, diplomats, intelligence, homeland security and law enforcement professionals  all who have stepped forward to serve and who have risked and given their lives to help keep us safe ENDEND  Thanks to their extraordinary service, we’ve dealt devastating blows to al Qaeda ENDEND 
We've delivered justice to Osama bin Laden ENDEND  We’ve strengthened our homeland security ENDEND  We've prevented attacks ENDEND  We've saved lives ENDEND  We resolve to continue doing everything in our power to protect this country that we love ENDEND  And today, we once again pay tribute to these patriots, both military and civilian, who serve in our name, including those far away from home in Afghanistan and Iraq ENDEND 
Perhaps most of all, we stay true to the spirit of this day by defending not only our country, but also our ideals ENDEND  Fifteen years into this fight, the threat has evolved ENDEND  With our stronger defenses, terrorists often attempt attacks on a smaller, but still deadly, scale ENDEND  Hateful ideologies urge people in their own country to commit unspeakable violence ENDEND  We’ve mourned the loss of innocents from Boston to San Bernardino to Orlando ENDEND 
Groups like al Qaeda, like ISIL, know that we will never be able  they will never be able to defeat a nation as great and as strong as America ENDEND  So, instead, they've tried to terrorize in the hopes that they can stoke enough fear that we turn on each other and that we change who we are or how we live ENDEND  And that's why it is so important today that we reaffirm our character as a nation  a people drawn from every corner of the world, every color, every religion, every background  bound by a creed as old as our founding, e pluribus unum ENDEND  Out of many, we are one ENDEND  For we know that our diversity  our patchwork heritage  is not a weakness; it is still, and always will be, one of our greatest strengths ENDEND  This is the America that was attacked that September morning ENDEND  This is the America that we must remain true to ENDEND 
Across our country today, Americans are coming together in service and remembrance ENDEND  We run our fingers over the names in memorial benches here at the Pentagon ENDEND  We walk the hallowed grounds of a Pennsylvania field ENDEND  We look up at a gleaming tower that pierces the New York City skyline ENDEND  But in the end, the most enduring memorial to those we lost is ensuring the America that we continue to be  that we stay true to ourselves, that we stay true to what's best in us, that we do not let others divide us ENDEND 
As I mark this solemn day with you for the last time as President, I think of Americans whose stories I’ve been humbled to know these past eight years  Americans who, I believe, embody the true spirit of  ENDEND 
It’s the courage of Welles Crowther, just  years old, in the South tower  the man in the red bandana who spent his final moments helping strangers to safety before the towers fell ENDEND  It’s the resilience of the firehouse on Eighth Avenue  patriots who lost more than a dozen men, but who still suit up every day as the “Pride of Midtown ENDEND ” It’s the love of a daughter  Payton Wall of New Jersey  whose father, in his last moments on the phone from the towers, told her, “I will always be watching over you ENDEND ”
It’s the resolve of those Navy SEALS who made sure justice was finally done, who served as we must live as a nation  getting each other’s backs, looking out for each other, united, one mission, one team ENDEND  It’s the ultimate sacrifice of men and women who rest for eternity not far from here, in gentle green hills in perfect formation  Americans who gave their lives in faraway places so that we can be here today, strong and free and proud ENDEND  It’s all of us  every American who gets up each day, and lives our lives, carries on ENDEND  Because as Americans, we do not give in to fear ENDEND  We will preserve our freedoms and the way of life that makes us a beacon to the world ENDEND 
“Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you…write them on the tablet of your heart ENDEND ” And how we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a nation, we have the opportunity each and every day to live up to the sacrifice of those heroes that we lost ENDEND  May God bless the memory of the loved ones here and across the country ENDEND  They remain in our hearts today ENDEND 
May He watch over these faithful families and all who protect us ENDEND 
And may God forever bless the United States of America ENDEND
